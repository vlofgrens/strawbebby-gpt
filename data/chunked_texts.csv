wong. 2010,"Understanding skew deviation and a new clinical test to  differentiate it from trochlear nerve palsy Agnes M. F. Wong, MD, PhD Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, The Hospital for Sick Children and University  of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada SUMMARY Skew deviation is a vertical strabismus caused by a supranuclear lesion in the posterior fossa.  Because skew deviation may clinically mimic trochlear nerve palsy, it is sometimes difficult to  differentiate the 2 conditions. In this review we compare the clinical presentations of skew  deviation and trochlear nerve palsy and examine the pathophysiology that underlies skew  deviation. We then describe a novel clinical test—the upright–supine test—to differentiate skew  deviation from trochlear nerve palsy: a vertical deviation that decreases by ≥50% from the upright  to supine position suggests skew deviation and warrants investigation for a lesion in the posterior  fossa as the cause of vertical diplopia. Skew deviation is a vertical strabismus caused by supranuclear lesions. It is often associated  with ocular torsion and head tilt, which together constitute the ocular tilt reaction.1–4 Skew  deviation is often the initial manifestation of diseases that affect the brainstem, cerebellum,  or peripheral vestibular system.4–10 Because both skew deviation and trochlear nerve palsy  may result from intracranial lesions or trauma, and because some skew deviations may  clinically mimic trochlear nerve palsy, differentiating these 2 conditions can be challenging.  Understanding skew deviation remains difficult, partly because it requires knowledge of the  underlying anatomy and pathophysiology. In this review, we first compare the clinical  presentation of skew deviation versus trochlear nerve palsy. We then focus on the  pathophysiologic mechanism of skew deviation and examine some current evidence that  shows that skew deviation results from an imbalance of the utriculo-ocular pathway. We then  present a novel upright–supine test that can be used clinically to differentiate skew deviation  from trochlear nerve palsy at the bedside. Clinical Presentation Skew deviation was first induced experimentally in animals by Magendie11 and later  Hertwig,12 who produced skew deviation in cats by sectioning the middle cerebellar  peduncle."

Rarely, it alternates with eye position (eg, right hypertropia  on right gaze and left hypertropia on left gaze).14,15 Skew deviation often is associated with  other neurologic signs and may be part of the ocular tilt reaction, which consists of a triad of  skew deviation, ocular torsion, and head tilt.1–3,10 In ocular tilt reaction, the pathologic head  tilt is ipsilateral to the hypotropic eye, and the ocular torsion is such that the upper poles of  both eyes rotate in the same direction as that of the head tilt (ie, the hypotropic eye is  excyclotorted and the hypertropic eye incyclotorted).9 This is in contrast to physiologic  counterroll (see below), during which the upper poles of both eyes rotate in the opposite  direction to that of the head tilt. In skew deviation, the ocular torsion may be conjugate or dissociated between the 2 eyes, or  it may be present in one eye only. Acutely, torsional nystagmus is commonly present.  Patients with ocular tilt reaction also show a deviation of the subjective visual vertical— when presented with an earth-vertical line in a dark room in the absence of other visual cues,"
wong. 2010,"patients perceive the line as tilted toward the same side as the head tilt.9 Skew deviation and  ocular tilt reaction are most commonly caused by ischemia, infarction, multiple sclerosis,  tumor, trauma, abscess, hemorrhage, syringobulbia, and neurosurgical procedures.4–6 They  can also be a finding in the setting of raised intracranial pressure.16 Distinguishing From Trochlear Nerve Palsy Trochlear nerve palsy is commonly diagnosed clinically with the “Park’s three-step test.”17  In contrast, the vertical misalignment in skew deviation does not follow any set patterns; it  may be comitant or incomitant, or it may even alternate with gaze direction.7,14,18 Some  skew deviations are known to mimic trochlear nerve palsy during the 3-step test—the  magnitude of hypertropia in skew deviation may increase with ipsilateral head tilt; however,  it may also increase with contralateral head tilt, or it may not change with head tilt at all. 19,20 Conversely, trochlear nerve palsy with spread of comitance may simulate a comitant  skew deviation because in both conditions the head is usually tilted contralateral to the side  of the hypertropic eye. However, the head tilt in trochlear nerve palsy is a compensatory  mechanism to minimize the amount of hypertropia, whereas in skew deviation it reflects the  underlying pathologic mechanism (see Pathophysiology section). Because skew deviation and trochlear nerve palsy may both result from brain trauma or from  lesions in the posterior fossa,21 and because skew deviation can mimic a trochlear nerve  palsy, indirect ophthalmoscopy is useful to differentiate these 2 conditions—the fundus is  excyclotorted in the hypertropic eye in trochlear nerve palsy, but it is incyclotorted in the  hypertropic eye in skew deviation if abnormal torsion is present. The fundus of the  hypotropic eye in skew deviation is excyclotorted.9,22,23 In addition, other neurologic signs  usually are present in skew deviation but not in trochlear nerve palsy (unless it is caused by a  brain trauma or lesion in the brainstem), including gaze-evoked nystagmus, gaze palsy,"

CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript Lesion Location Acute peripheral vestibulopathy affecting the vestibular organ or its nerve (eg, vestibular  neuritis),2,25,26 diseases of the vestibular nuclei in the medulla (eg, lateral medullary  syndrome),27 pons,28 medial longitudinal fasciculus (eg, internuclear ophthalmoplegia),29,30  midbrain (eg, dorsal midbrain syndrome),6,14,31–33 as well as the diencephalon (eg, thalamic  infarcts)34 have been reported to cause skew deviation or ocular tilt reaction. It has been  attributed to asymmetric disruption of the utriculo-ocular pathway. The utriculo-ocular  pathway has usually been assumed to be disynaptic—primary afferents from otolithic  receptors of the utricle in the inner ear project to second-order neurons in the vestibular  nuclei, the axons of which then project to the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei via the medial  longitudinal fasciculus.1,6 There is growing evidence, however, that this disynaptic pathway  is weak and that polysynaptic pathways via the cerebellum play a more important role.35  Lesions in the vestibular periphery, vestibular nuclei, medulla, and the caudal pons cause  ipsilesional hypotropia and head tilt. Because otolithic projections from the vestibular nuclei  cross the midline at the level of the pons to ascend along the medial longitudinal fasciculus,  lesions in the rostral pons and midbrain cause contralesional hypotropia and head tilt (eg,  internuclear ophthalmoplegia or midbrain lesions).9 Typically, the ocular torsion in skew deviation is conjugate in both eyes for most lesion  locations (ie, the hypotropic eye excyclotorts and the hypertropic eye incyclotorts)9;"
wong. 2010,"however, in lateral medullary syndrome, the ocular torsion is usually monocular (or  dissociate)—the hypotropic eye is excyclotorted but incyclotorsion is absent (or small) in the  hypertropic eye.27 Ascertaining whether abnormal torsion is present in one or both eyes and  whether it is conjugate is clinically useful to differentiate between skew deviation  (supranuclear) and nuclear-fascicular trochlear nerve palsy caused by a lesion in the  midbrain. An unilateral trochlear nerve palsy is associated with monocular torsion, whereas  a midbrain skew deviation is associated with binocular, conjugate torsion (ie, the hypotropic  eye excyclotorts and the hypertropic eye incyclotorts).9 In unilateral trochlear nerve palsy,  the pathologic monocular torsion usually presents as excyclotorsion of the paretic  hypertropic eye only; however, excyclotorsion (12°–14°) of the nonparetic hypotropic eye  only has also been documented.36 In the case of bilateral trochlear nerve palsy, the torsion is  disjunctive with excyclotorsion in both eyes, but it is conjugate in skew deviation. Damage to the cerebellum also has been implicated as a cause of skew deviation when the  middle cerebellar peduncle was sectioned in cats,11,12 but adjacent tegmental structures in  the brainstem may have been damaged also. Others5–7 have attributed skew deviation to  cerebellar damage from surgery5,13 or cerebellar diseases on the basis of clinical findings. 6,7,13 In most cases,5–7,13,14,18,37 however, brainstem involvement had not been excluded by  either neuroimaging or pathological correlation. To document that a discrete lesion in the  cerebellum alone can cause skew deviation, we described in detail the clinical course of 5  patients with skew deviation caused by focal cerebellar lesions. Their lesions were identified  by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with or without pathological correlation.10 These  patients either had a vascular tumor or infarction in the cerebellar hemisphere or vermis or  both.Wong Page 3 J AAPOS ."
wong. 2010,"Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 December 13. CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript Pathophysiology In normal humans, when the head is tilted about the naso-occipital axis, the utricles are  activated primarily to generate compensatory torsional eye movements in a direction  opposite the head tilt.38–40 This torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex, termed ocular counterroll,  however, compensates for only about 10% to 20% of the head tilt (eg, a 20° head tilt toward  the right shoulder will result in the upper pole of both eyes to rotate 2° to 4° toward the left  shoulder).38–40 Static ocular counterroll is important from a clinical standpoint because this  otolith-driven reflex forms the basis of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test and it explains the  compensatory head tilt in patients with trochlear nerve palsy. In normal humans, for  example, during right head tilt, the static ocular counterroll activates the right superior  oblique and superior rectus muscles, causing the right eye to incyclotort and elevate slightly. 41 Simultaneously, the static ocular counterroll activates the left inferior oblique and inferior  rectus muscles, causing the left eye to excyclotort and depress slightly.41 This reflexive  vertical movement of the eyes is partly compensatory to downward translation of the right  eye and upward translation of the left eye relative to the earth-horizontal plane due to the  head tilt.41 In a patient with right trochlear nerve palsy, however, during right head tilt, the elevating  action of the superior rectus is unopposed by the palsied superior oblique in the right eye;  thus, the right hypertropia increases during right (ipsilateral) head tilt, constituting a positive  Bielschowsky head-tilt test (see also Jampolsky).42 Conversely, these patients often adopt a  compensatory left (contralateral) head tilt to minimize their vertical strabismus and diplopia.  Recently, however, there is some controversy about the existence of ocular counterroll.43 We  provided further evidence to confirm its existence by demonstrating that the magnitude of"
wong. 2010,"ocular counterroll responses is dependent on the age of subjects, viewing distance, target  characteristics, and whether or not the target moves simultaneously with the head.44,45 The ocular tilt reaction is a pathological synkinetic triad of skew deviation, ocular torsion,  and head tilt. It has been attributed to lesions in the vestibular organ and its nerve, and  central connections within the brainstem or cerebellum that asymmetrically disrupt the  utriculo-ocular pathway. The utriculo-ocular reflex originates in the maculae of the otolith  organ, the utricle, which act as linear accelerometers. The hair cells on the maculae of the  utricles have a wide range of polarization vectors that are sensitive to head motion in  different directions, and they are oriented roughly in the horizontal plane. Thus the utricles  normally mediate the linear or translational vestibulo-ocular reflex during translational  motion of the head (ie, right-and-left and fore-and-aft head movements), as well as ocular  counterroll during static head tilt (ie, head position with respect to gravity). Normally,  balanced signals from the utriculo-ocular pathway are used to align the head’s vertical axis  and the eye’s vertical meridian with absolute earth-vertical (gravity) when stationary.  Damages to the utriculo-ocular pathway lead to an erroneous internal estimate of absolute  earth-vertical (gravity); that is, the brain erroneously computes that the head is tilted despite  that fact that the head is in an upright position and that the utricles lie in the horizontal plane.  The triad of head tilt, skew deviation, and abnormal torsion seen in ocular tilt reaction  represents a righting response, the goal of which is to realign the vertical axes of both the  head and the eyes to the internal estimate of, albeit erroneous, absolute earth-vertical.4,46Wong Page 4 J AAPOS . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 December 13. CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript Abnormal static ocular torsion has been demonstrated in patients with skew deviation when  they look straight ahead; however, it is unknown whether, or how, torsion is altered during  dynamic eye movements or during different gaze directions and whether the relationship of"
wong. 2010,"ocular torsion with horizontal and vertical eye position (ie, Listing’s law) is intact in skew  deviation. We found that in skew deviation, torsion was abnormal during fixation and  dynamic eye movements (saccades) to different gaze directions. Interestingly, we also found  that the relationship of ocular torsion with horizontal and vertical eye position was disrupted  acutely, but not when the skew deviation is chronic (ie, ≥4 weeks’ duration), suggesting that  the neural circuitry underlying Listing’s law is adaptive and is capable of restoring the law  with time. What is the functional advantage of restoring Listing’s law? It enhances motor  efficiency by minimizing the rotational eccentricity of the eye,47,48 thereby reducing the  work load on the eye muscles against their elastic recoiling force. In addition, by keeping the  eye near the center of its torsional range, Listing’s law allows the eye to respond quickly to  targets that may appear unpredictably from any direction.49,50 New Pathophysiologic Evidence Almost 3 decades have passed since imbalance of the utriculo-ocular reflex was first  proposed as responsible for skew deviation and ocular tilt reaction.1,6 However, surprisingly  few studies have quantitatively documented abnormal otolith function in these patients. 10,51,52 As discussed, the utricles normally mediate the linear vestibulo-ocular reflex during  translational motion of the head as well as ocular counterroll during static head tilt in  response to a change in head position with respect to gravity. We postulate that if skew  deviation is indeed caused by imbalance of otolithic projections to ocular motor neurons,  then in patients with skew deviation, the ocular counterroll would be abnormal, the linear  vestibular ocular reflex would be abnormal, and the abnormal torsion and vertical strabismus  might be head position dependent. In our first study, we investigated whether static ocular counterroll responses are abnormal in  patients with skew deviation.10 Three patients with skew deviation caused by cerebellar  lesions and 10 normal subjects were tested. We measured their ocular responses to static,  passive head tilts of 30° toward each shoulder during monocular viewing. We found that  static ocular counterroll gains were asymmetrical in each patient. This gain asymmetry"
wong. 2010,"between the eyes (right vs left) or between directions of head tilt (toward right vs left  shoulder) or both provides evidence that imbalance of the utriculo-ocular reflex leads to  cerebellar skew deviation. In a second study, we investigated whether linear vestibulo-ocular reflex responses are  abnormal in patients with skew deviation.53 Six patients with skew deviation caused by  brainstem or cerebellar lesions and 10 normal subjects were studied. All subjects underwent  brief, sudden, interaural translations of the head (ie, head heaves)54 while continuously  fixating an earth-fixed target monocularly. We found that linear vestibulo-ocular reflex  sensitivities (the ratio of peak rotational eye velocity to peak linear head velocity) and  velocity gains (the ratio of peak actual to geometrically ideal rotational eye velocities) in  patients were decreased by 56% to 62% in both eyes as compared to normal subjects. This  binocular reduction in linear vestibulo-ocular reflex responses was asymmetric—the Wong Page 5 J AAPOS . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 December 13. CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript magnitude of reduction differed between eyes by 37% to 143% for sensitivities, and by 36%  to 94% for velocity gains. We concluded that the binocular but asymmetric reduction in  linear vestibulo-ocular reflex sensitivity and velocity gain provides additional evidence that  imbalance in the utriculo-ocular pathway is a mechanism of skew deviation. A New Clinical Test In a third study, we investigated whether the abnormal ocular torsion and vertical  misalignment in skew deviation differed in the upright vs supine positions.55 We tested 10  patients with skew deviation, 14 with unilateral peripheral trochlear nerve palsy, and 12  normal participants. Skew deviation was defined as: (1) a vertical misalignment (with or  without head tilt or fundus torsion), the pattern of which was inconsistent with that found in  palsy of one or more cyclovertical muscles; (2) presence of lesions in the posterior fossa on  MRI; and (3) presence of neurologic symptoms and signs. Unilateral peripheral trochlear"
wong. 2010,"nerve palsy was defined as: (1) deficient depression of the hypertropic eye in adduction; (2)  incomitant hypertropia which increased with adduction of the hypertropic eye, and with  head tilt toward the hypertropic eye; (3) presence of objective or subjective  excyclodeviation, ie, torsional diplopia; (4) absence of any neurologic symptoms and signs  suggestive of lesions in the trochlear nucleus or fascicle; and (5) negative MRI. Ocular  torsion was measured by double Maddox rods while the subject fixated on a small white  pen-light located at a distance of 1 m in the midsagittal plane at eye level. Vertical  misalignment was measured by the prism and alternate cover test while the subject fixated  on a single letter e of optotype size 3/32 inch (12-point font size) at a distance of 1 m away. We found that in skew deviation abnormal torsion and vertical misalignment are head  position-dependent—they decreased substantially or disappeared completely when the head  changed from an upright position to a supine position. In contrast, in unilateral peripheral  trochlear nerve palsy, there were little or no changes in the torsional or vertical deviation  between the 2 head positions. Torsion was decreased by 83% in skew deviation, by 2% in  trochlear nerve palsy, and by 6% in normal subjects ( p < 0.001). Similarly, vertical  misalignment was decreased by 74% in skew deviation, increased by 5% in trochlear nerve  palsy, and increased by 6% in normal subjects ( p < 0.001).55 The head position-dependent changes in torsion and vertical misalignment we55  demonstrated provide the basis of additional tests that could be used clinically to  differentiate skew deviation from trochlear nerve palsy. On the basis of the results from our  previous study,55 we sought to investigate further the sensitivity and specificity of this new  upright–supine test by defining a positive test as one in which the vertical misalignment  decreased by ≥50% from the upright to supine position. By using the same definitions for  skew deviation and trochlear nerve palsy as in our previous study,55 to date we have"
wong. 2010,"recruited 17 patients with skew deviation, 40 patients with trochlear nerve palsy, and 25  patients with other causes of vertical strabismus (eg, dysthyroidism, orbital trauma, Brown  syndrome, childhood strabismus, peripheral oculomotor or abducens nerve palsy).56,57 Our preliminary (unpublished) results indicated that 13 of 17 patients with skew deviation  had a positive upright–supine test, giving the test a sensitivity of 76%. No patients with Wong Page 6 J AAPOS . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 December 13. CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript trochlear nerve palsy or other causes of vertical strabismus had a positive upright–supine  test, giving the test a specificity of 100%. Interestingly, all 4 patients with skew deviation  who had a negative upright–supine test had a lesion in the midbrain on MRI, which may  have caused a vertical strabismus as a result of a combination of skew deviation and  trochlear nerve palsy (with or without concurrent oculomotor nerve palsy). Furthermore,  they all had additional neurologic signs (eg, vertical gaze palsy, facial nerve palsy, bilateral  ptosis). What is the physiological basis of this new upright–supine test? We postulate that when  changing from an upright to supine position, the orientation of the utricles changes from  earth-horizontal to earth-vertical. This new orientation of the utricle with respect to absolute  earth-vertical (gravity) leads to a saturation or reduction in the overall afferent activities of  the utriculo-ocular reflex, such that any asymmetry of the reflex (as in skew deviation) is  minimized. This saturation or reduction in activities and asymmetry of the reflex in the  supine position in turn leads to the reduction of torsion and vertical misalignment in skew  deviation. Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, our findings that torsion  and vertical misalignment decrease when changing from an upright to supine position in  skew deviation are consistent with the currently accepted role of the utricles in detecting  changes in head orientation, and provide support that skew deviation is caused by disruption"
wong. 2010,"of the utriculo-ocular reflex. It should be noted that in isolated unilateral peripheral trochlear nerve palsy, the utriculo- ocular pathway remains intact. Thus the magnitude of vertical deviation and excyclotorsion  in the hypertropic eye remains the same in upright and supine positions. The contralateral  head tilt commonly seen in unilateral trochlear nerve palsy is a compensatory mechanism  that exploits the normal intact utriculo-ocular reflex to minimize the magnitude of vertical  deviation and diplopia. Sydnor et al58 found that the head tilt in unilateral trochlear nerve  palsy disappears in supine position. Because there is no change in utricular input or  stimulation with head tilts when supine, the utriculo-ocular reflex is no longer effective in  reducing the vertical deviation in unilateral trochlear nerve palsy in the supine position and  thus the head tilt disappears.58 This is also the reason why the Bielschowsky head tilt test is  not applicable in a supine position and should not be used in a bedridden patient who cannot  sit in an upright position. The double Maddox rods (ie, subjective torsion) and the prism and alternate cover test we  used are simple and quick to perform. They can be performed with a near target as long as  its distance from the patient is kept constant in both upright and supine positions. They also  have the advantage of not requiring pupillary dilation or indirect ophthalmoscopy, which  may not be readily available or feasible for nonophthalmologists, including neurologists and  orthoptists. Fundus photography could also be used to document the change in objective  torsion in skew deviation, but it requires special equipment (eg, Retcam; Clarity Medical  Systems, Inc, Pleasanton, CA) that has the flexibility of taking fundus pictures in the supine  position. Whatever method one chooses to measure torsion and vertical strabismus, the head  position-dependent changes in torsion and vertical misalignment suggest skew deviation,  and warrant investigation for a lesion in the posterior fossa as the cause of the vertical  deviation and diplopia.Wong Page 7 J AAPOS . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 December 13. CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript Summary"
wong. 2010,"On the basis of our findings, we recommend the following (see Figure 1): when a patient  presents with a vertical strabismus, a dissociated vertical deviation and pseudostrabismus  (eg, ptosis, orbital or facial dysmorphism) should be ruled out. A mechanical restrictive  cause also should be sought from the patient’s history and clinical examination. If there is  any sign of mechanical restriction, an orbital computed tomography or MRI should be  ordered. If no sign of mechanical restriction is present, the 3-step test should then be  performed. If the 3-step test is negative for trochlear nerve palsy and is suggestive of  weakness of other cyclovertical muscles, a brain MRI with gadolinium enhancement should  be performed because skew deviation can mimic palsy of any of the cyclovertical muscles.  In addition, it is very unlikely for an oculomotor nerve palsy to present with isolated  weakness of the superior rectus, inferior rectus, or inferior oblique muscle without ptosis or  pupillary dilation. One should also suspect myasthenia gravis if other signs are present (eg,  fatigability and variability of ptosis or diplopia). If the 3-step test is positive for trochlear  nerve palsy, the upright–supine test should then be performed with a near target at 1/3 meter  in both the upright and supine position. If this test is positive, that is, the vertical deviation  decreases by ≥50% from the upright to supine position, a brain MRI with gadolinium  enhancement should be performed to rule out a lesion in the posterior fossa because skew  deviation can mimic a trochlear nerve palsy during the 3-step test. If, on the other hand, the upright–supine test is negative, that is, the vertical deviation  decreases by <50% from the upright to supine position, then one should look for any  additional neurologic signs (eg, gaze-evoked nystagmus, gaze palsy, facial nerve palsy,  dysarthria, ataxia, hemiplegia). If other neurologic signs are present, a brain MRI with  gadolinium enhancement should be performed; if they are absent, the vertical strabismus is"
wong. 2010,"likely caused by a peripheral trochlear nerve palsy. In this situation, signs that are suggestive  of a congenital cause should be looked for (eg, presence of a head tilt in old photographs,  facial asymmetry, or increased vertical fusional amplitude). If these signs for a congenital  cause are absent, the clinician should use his/her clinical judgment to decide whether  neuroimaging is warranted. The aforementioned algorithm is particularly useful when abnormal torsion is absent or not  noticeable because although abnormal torsion is found in approximately 80% of patients  with skew deviation,28 it is found only in approximately 40% of patients with trochlear  nerve palsy.36 If abnormal torsion is present, dilated fundus examination or double Maddox  rods are helpful in differentiating skew deviation from trochlear nerve palsy. In unilateral  trochlear nerve palsy, the torsion is monocular (ie, excyclotorsion of the paretic hypertropic  eye only, or a small excyclotorsion of the nonparetic hypotropic eye only36), whereas in  bilateral trochlear nerve palsy, the torsion is binocular but disjunctive (ie, excyclotorsion of  both eyes). In most skew deviations except for those caused by a lesion in the lateral  medulla, the torsion is binocular and conjugate (ie, excyclotorsion of the hypotropic eye and  incyclotorsion of the hypertropic eye).9 In patients with lateral medullary syndrome, the  ocular torsion is monocular (ie, the hypotropic eye is excyclotorted, but the hypertropic eye  has normal torsion or is slightly incyclotorted), and more importantly, these patients  typically present with characteristic neurologic signs.9,27Wong Page 8 J AAPOS . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 December 13. CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript CIHR Author Manuscript In conclusion, there is increasing evidence that skew deviation is caused by an imbalance in  the utriculo-ocular pathway. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of skew  deviation has led to the discovery of a new bedside test to supplement the classic Park’s 3- step test in differentiating skew deviation from trochlear nerve palsy."

Brodsky. 2006,"MAJOR REVIEW Skew Deviation Revisited Michael C. Brodsky, MD,1Sean P. Donahue, MD, PhD,2Michael Vaphiades, DO,3 and Thomas Brandt, MD4 1Departments of Ophthalmology and Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA; 2Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Pediatrics, and Neurology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA;3Department of Ophthalmology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, USA; and4Department of Neurology, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Mu ¨nich, Germany Abstract. Skew deviation is a vertical misalignment of the eyes caused by damage to prenuclear vestibular input to ocular motor nuclei. The resultant vertical ocular deviation is relatively comitant innature, and is usually seen in the context of brainstem or cerebellar injury from stroke, multiple sclerosis, or trauma. Skew deviation is usually accompanied by binocular torsion, torticollis, and a tilt in the subjective visual vertical. This constellation of ﬁndings has been termed the ocular tilt reaction. In the past two decades, a clinical localizing value for skew deviation has been assigned, and a cogentvestibular mechanism for comitant and incomitant variants of skew deviation has been proposed. Our understanding of skew deviation as a manifestation of central otolithic dysfunction in different planes of three-dimensional space is evolving. The similar spectrum of vertical ocular deviations arising inpatients with congenital strabismus may further expand the nosology of skew deviation to include vergence abnormalities caused by the effects of early binocular visual imbalance on the developing visual system.

Brodsky. 2006,"deviation refers to ‘‘a hypertropia in which the eyesmove in opposite directions equally; an acquiredhypertropia, often fairly comitant, not ﬁtting thecharacteristic pattern of trochlear nerve damage orof ocular muscle abnormality; often due to a brain-stem or cerebellar lesion.’’ For many years, skewdeviation was held to be a nonlocalizing sign and a diagnosis of exclusion. 84,112Skew deviation usually presents as a comitant hypertropia in a patient withposterior fossa disease. 44In rare cases, however, it can increase in one horizontal direction of gaze,manifest as a paroxysmal hyperdeviation of one eye, or produce alternating hyperdeviations in gaze toeither side. 44,181The purpose of this review is to acquaint the reader with advances in our under-standing of skew deviation as a clinical diagnosticentity, in terms of its clinical range of presentation, its underlying pathophysiology, and its clinical localizing value. II. History Skew deviation was ﬁrst recognized experimentally in animals by the experimental physiologist Francois 105 /C2112006 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.0039-6257/06/$--see front matter doi:10.1016/j.survophthal.2005.12.008SURVEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY VOLUME 51 /C15NUMBER 2 /C15MARCH–APRIL 2006  Magendie in 1824.131The following year, Henry Hertwig described skew deviation in a cat followingan incision through the cerebellum into the me-dulla. 100,182In 1904, Stewart and Holmes observed skew deviation in a man with a cerebellar tumor, andin other patients following craniotomies for cerebel-lar tumors. 186During World War I, Gordon Holmes documented skew deviation in 5 of 40 patients who had sustained cerebellar gunshot injuries.104In 1921, Holmes theorized that skew deviation wasobserved only in patients with extensive cerebellarlesions and otherwise had no localizing value. 103In 1925, Po ¨tzl and Sittig described skew deviation in"
Brodsky. 2006,"a patient with a lesion in the ventral caudal portionof the vestibular complex and referred to it as theHertwig-Magendiescher Schielstellung. 155In 1926, Brain reported skew deviation with head tilting in a patient with chronic otitis media.19 In his 1956 book Neurology of the Eye Muscles , Cogan observed that skew deviation was common withlesions of the cerebellum (tumors, abscesses, andvascular and post-surgical lesions) and in lesions ofthe vestibular nuclei, nerve, and end organ. 44He observed that the eye on the side of the lesion was directed downward and the opposite eye upward. Cogan attributed skew deviation to a lesion in-volving the vestibulo-ocular pathways but empha-sized that, ‘‘evidence is scanty for localization, otherthan the general region of the posterior fossa.’’ 44In 1961, Smith et al noted that skew deviation mayaccompany internuclear ophthalmoplegia, in whichcase the higher eye is usually on the side of the lesion. 181,182They considered skew deviation to fall into three clinical subtypes: comitant ,laterally comitant (actually an incomitant skew deviation in which the hyperdeviation increases in one lateral ﬁeld ofgaze), and a laterally alternating skew deviation in which there is a hyperdeviation of the abducting eyein each lateral ﬁeld of gaze. 181 In 1975, Keane described 100 patients with skew deviation. Most patients had unilateral lesions involving the pons, but lesions within the medullaand midbrain were also common. 116As in previous reports, the hypotropic eye tended to be on the sideof the lesion except in cases of unilateral internu-clear ophthalmoplegia (INO), where the higher eyewas on the side of the lesion. Keane attributed skewdeviation to a lesion involving the otolithic path- ways, which can be injured at any site as they ascend within the brainstem. 115He also noted that the natural history of skew deviation tended towardspontaneous resolution. The role of the vestibular system and brainstem in the control of head-eye posture in the roll plane hasbeen recognized for almost a century."
Brodsky. 2006,"19,89,102,132,143 In 1975, Westheimer and Blair provided what was tobe a unifying explanation for skew deviation when they electrically stimulated the brainstem tegmen-tum of alert monkeys and noted a vertical deviation(skew deviation) and rotation (cyclotorsion) of theeyes conjugately and equally in the direction of theinfraducted eye. They assigned the name ocular tilt reaction and stated that clinical skew deviation (Hertwig-Magendie phenomenon) and the ocular tilt reaction were identical phenomena. 215,216In retrospect, the ocular tilt reaction had been pro-duced by Muskins in 1914, 143documented in different species by Magnus et al,132and described later by investigators in the scientiﬁc201and veter- inary literature.171,214These reports suggested that when skew deviation is due to a lesion in the rostralend of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), the ipsilateral eye may be higher. 133 In 1977, Rabinovitch et al provided the ﬁrst clinically recognized report of a human ocular tiltreaction. 156Two years later, Halmagyi et al docu- mented an ocular tilt reaction in a woman followingunilateral stapedectomy. 91They correctly attributed it to a compensatory response that followed unilateralinjury to the vestibular pathway that arises in the utricle of the dependent ear and projected to the opposite brainstem. Numerous descriptions of the humanocular tilt reaction ( Fig. 1 ) have since followed, and Fig. 1. Ocular tilt reaction. Top Left : Facial photograph shows mild left head tilt.

In summary, skew deviation was, until recently,"
Brodsky. 2006,"considered to be a vertical misalignment of the eyesthat was uncommon, usually seen in neurologicallydebilitated patients, and nonspeciﬁcally localizingexcept to the posterior fossa. In the past twodecades, however, dedicated studies have shown that skew deviation is common, that its causative lesion can be focal, that it can be seen in otherwiseintact ambulatory patients, and that it occurs in themore general context of an ocular tilt reaction. III. Causes Skew deviation can result from any acute injury within the posterior fossa (ischemic infarction, multiple sclerosis, tumor, trauma, abscess, hemor-rhage, syringobulbia, or neurosurgical proce-dures). 12,44,116,181The majority of cases are seen in association with brainstem stroke.61,181A lesion need not involve the brainstem or cerebellum tocause skew deviation, however. Acute unilateralvestibular lesions can also cause skew devia- tion. 61,63,90,91,113,116,167,219 Numerous rarer causes of skew deviation have been documented.116Several reports have docu- mented skew deviation in patients with increasedintracranial pressure. 9,76,134Skew deviation may accompany paroxysmal hemiparesis of child-hood. 66,97Cogan described skew deviation in one patient with Arnold-Chiari malformation and in two individuals with platybasia.45Galimberti et al de- scribed paroxymal epileptic skew deviation ina patient who was otherwise neurologically intact. 80 They attributed it to ictal activation of the vestibularcortex with secondary activation of descendingprojections to the vestibular nuclei. Suzuki et aldescribed three patients who developed diplopiaand skew deviation following cardiac catheteriza- tion. 192Negative neuroimaging studies were sugges- tive of minor ischemic damage to the brainstem.Yokota et al described skew deviation with alternat-ing hypertropia of the abducting eye in threepatients with Creutzfelt-Jakob disease. 222 Ragge et al described an ocular tilt reaction in a"
Brodsky. 2006,"5-year-old girl with a mesencephalic lesion andpolyarteritis nodosa. 158Skew deviation has also been reported in multifocal encephalopathy,17CNS cryp- tococcus,56hepatic coma,74following Mandrax overdosage,151from a unilateral cochleo-vestibular damage due to herpes zoster oticus,206in paraneo- plastic encephalomyelitis associated with benignovarian teratoma, 196and in adult Leigh disease.93 Chueng et al diagnosed skew deviation on prenatalMR images in a fetus with association with glioblas- toma involving the brainstem.43 IV. Evolutionary Underpinnings Classical skew deviation occurs in the context of anocular tilt reaction , in which bilateral otolithic input is leveraged by the central vestibular system to modulate extraocular muscle and postural tonus inthe roll plane (the plane in which the head or bodytilts from side to side). 136,176,223The ocular tilt reaction in humans is probably a vestigial remnantof the primitive otolithic righting reﬂex that isreleased only under pathological conditions. 136The relative preponderance of the individual compo- nents of head tilt, ocular torsion, and vertical eye movements, is dependent upon species differencesin the range of head movement and the orientationof the optic axes. 136The head tilt component is most prominent in animals with little eye move-ments, such as owls. 136,185The skew eye movement is most prominent in animals with mobile, laterallyplaced eyes, but no head movement in roll, such as ﬁsh. 136In these lateral-eyed animals, a body tilt around the long axis produces a rotation of the eyesthat is purely vertical. 11,204In the ﬁsh or a rabbit, for example, a rightward body tilt along its long axiscauses the right eye to be lower in space than the lefteye, which results in a compensatory skew deviationwith upward rotation of the lowermost right eye anddownward rotation of the uppermost left eye. 89The torsional eye movement (known as the ocular counter roll) is most prominent in frontal-eyedanimals such as cat and humans. 136"

In humans, the gain of the static ocular counterroll(the torsional component of the ocular tilt reaction)is only about 0.1, as the need for a compensatory eyetorsion reﬂex is reduced by a compensatory head tiltreﬂex. 49,59Pansell et al found that humans show a transient skew deviation at the initiation of a head tilt that is opposite to the ﬁnal skew deviation (i.e., right hypertropia during the initiation of a left headtilt). 152The subsequent dynamic skew deviation (left hypertropia during leftward tilt) is robustduring whole body oscillations around the naso-occipital axis, 113but only a trace static skew de- viation can be detected during static head or bodytilt (on the order of 0.3 degrees). 15,119,188In the normal individual, for example, prism alternate cover testing during head tilt will not evokea measurable hyperphoria. 39Given the magnitude of asymmetrical otolithic innervation evoked bya static head tilt, the virtual absence of a physiologicskew deviation must be taken as evidence that thefrontal-eyed system has evolved to inhibit this reﬂexin the interest of single binocular vision. V. Neuroanatomy The primary functions of the vestibulo-ocular system are to maintain eye position and stabilizeﬁxation during head movements. The labyrinthine receptors transduce the forces associated with headacceleration into a biological signal."
Brodsky. 2006,"136The semi- circular canals sense angular acceleration, while theotoliths (the saccules and utricles) respond to linearacceleration (i.e., head translation and the mostpervasive form of linear acceleration, the pull ofgravity). 136In lateral-eyed animals and in humans, the semicircular canals are roughly aligned with the long axis of the extraocular muscles ( Fig. 4 ).176 When the head is rotated in a particular plane, the semicircular canal that lies in the plane of rotationdetects acceleration and sends excitatory innerva-tion to its corresponding extraocular muscles. Inaddition to serving to stabilize gaze, the vestibulo-ocular pathways also provide ascending input to the thalamo-cortical projections of spatial percep- tion as well as descending input to vestibulo-spinal Fig. 3.

Brodsky. 2006,"viation), and postural (head tilt) manifestations,which together constitute the ocular tilt reaction. 29 Consequently, skew deviation is usually associatedwith lesions in the posterior fossa, particularly thoseinvolving the brainstem tegmentum from the di-encephalon to the medulla. 26It is also seen clinically in lesions of the utricle or vestibular nerve.28 Each anterior semicircular canal provides excit- atory input to the ipsilateral superior rectusand contralateral inferior oblique muscles(Fig. 5 ). 48,124,190Each posterior semicircular canal system provides excitatory innervation to the ipsilat-eral superior oblique and the contralateral inferiorrectus muscles while inhibiting the ipsilateral in-ferior oblique and the contralateral superior rectus muscles ( Fig. 5 ). Like their target extraocular muscles, the semicircular canals have a push--pull(yoke) relationship, so that activation of one canalinhibits the antagonist canal. 48,124,190Thus, injury to or inhibition of an anterior canal pathway causesfunctional activation of the ipsilateral posteriorcanal pathway. 24In addition to the semicircular canals, each labyrinth contains otolithic sensors consisting ofthe utricle and the saccule. 25,124Although some overlap exists,170the semicircular canals respond to angular acceleration and produce dynamic vestibulo-ocular movements (phasic ocular deviations andnystagmus), whereas the parallel otolithic systemresponds to linear acceleration and is sensitive to changes in static head position. 25,63,82,124,197The otolithic pathways are not as well studied, but arebelieved to have similar projections to the corre-sponding canal pathways. 124Static eye positions, the ocular counterroll, sensory input for subjectivevertical orientation, and conjugated vertical devia-tions such as skew deviation are mediated mainly bythe utricles, 25although recent evidence suggests that a semicircular canal imbalance may contribute to the cyclotropia in unilateral vestibular patients.170Grav- iceptive input from the otoliths converges with thatfrom the vertical semicircular canals at the level of thevestibular nuclei. 5,8,20,85,86,172Mathematical models"
Brodsky. 2006,"of biological systems have recently been applied tothe tonic and dynamic aspects of vestibulo-ocularfunction. 20,81,82 VI. Symptomatology Unilateral lesions or stimulation of the utricles or vertical semicircular canal pathways cause an imbal-ance of vestibular tone in the roll plane, whichresults either in a complete (tonic or paroxysmal)ocular tilt reaction or in single components of the ocular tilt reaction such as cyclorotation of the eyes or skew deviation. 64 In the pathological ocular tilt reaction, the eyes, head, and body are continuously adjusted to whatthe central nervous system erroneously computes asbeing vertical. 29This compensation causes a synki- netic rotation of the eyes, interpupillary axis, andhead in the roll plane to realign with the perceived vertical ( Fig. 6 ). 27When the patient’s head is moved to the true vertical, the patient may perceive it astilted in the opposite direction. 29However, the ocular torsion and head tilt are easily overlookedunless speciﬁcally sought. The fundamental association of skew deviation with ocular torsion and torticollis was overlooked formany years. 25,79Although Trobe202found no cyclo- deviation in patients with skew deviation,79the exclusion of patients with positive head tilt tests inthis study may have foreordained that result. 115This classic triad of ﬁndings is absent in some pa-tients. 23,90The ocular tilt reaction rarely causes symptoms by itself; it does not cause disequilibriumand may only induce vertical diplopia. 90 Fig. 5.

When this occurs, theupper poles of the eyes tend to beat away from theside of a medullary lesion and toward the side ofa midbrain lesion. 14,63,88,92,128The ocular tilt re- action and its associated skew deviation tend torecover spontaneously over weeks to months. 18,115VII. Subjective Visual Tilt The ocular tilt reaction is associated with a tilt in the subjective visual vertical . This term is often confusing to the uninitiated reader because thepatient remains asymptomatic, and even whenasked, states that his or her surroundings do notappear tilted. However, the patient’s subjectivevisual world (which he or she perceives as upright)is indeed tilted with respect to the true earthvertical. In this sense, the patient can be said to experience a subjective visual tilt. It is as if you tilted a television set to one side and then imagined whatthe television characters perceived. Because theirentire visual world is tilted together, they would tendto perceive themselves and their surroundings asnormal. Despite their tilt, all visual cues would tellthem that their internal world corresponds to trueearth coordinates. Such is the case in the patient with an ocular tilt reaction. In normal structured environments, ourlife-long experience persuades us as to horizontaland vertical orientations of rooms, houses, trees, andso on. For this reason, in the ocular tilt reaction theexaminer can only determine the perceived tilt ifa straight line is adjusted to ‘‘vertical’’ in darkness, orin surroundings which provide no cue for true vertical. A patient with a left ocular tilt reaction, for example, will experience a tilt in the subjective visualvertical that is counterclockwise (from the patient’sperspective) because diminished input from the leftutricle causes the brain to perceive the head ashaving been tilted to the right ( Fig. 6 ). Under clinical conditions the patient’s head reﬂexivelyrotates to align with the internally perceived vertical. Under testing conditions, the patient would adjust a vertical line in a counterclockwise direction until itcorresponds to this altered internal sense of vertical.The subjective visual tilt can be identiﬁed usingDouble Maddox rods 209or by placing the patient’s"
Brodsky. 2006,"head in a half-spherical dome and instructing him orher to adjust a potentiometer to vertically situate anobserved line. 29Either test must be performed separately with each eye occluded, and several measurements must be averaged. A tilt in thesubjective visual vertical can also be suspected byobserving the slant of personal photographs beingtaken or by observing the slant of handwriting withthe eyes closed. 29In the ocular tilt reaction, the observed errors in tilt orientation are always in thesame direction as the observed ocular torsion. The ocular tilt reaction strives to realign the eyes and head to a tilted position that the brainerroneously computes as vertical (note that theensuing cyclorotation of the eyes counterrotate thetilted subjective visual vertical back to true vertical Fig. 6. Graviceptive pathways from the otoliths and vertical semicircular canals mediating the vestibularreactions in the roll plane. The projections from theotoliths and the vertical semicircular canals to the ocular motor nuclei (trochlear nucleus IV, oculomotor nucleus III, abducens nucleus VI), and the supranuclear centers ofthe interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), and the rostralinterstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) are shown. They subserve vestibuloocular reﬂex (VOR) in three planes. The VOR is part of a morecomplex vestibular reaction that also involves vestibulo- spinal connections via the medial and lateral vestibulospi- nal tracts for head and body posture control. Note thatgraviceptive vestibular pathways for the roll plane cross atthe pontine level. Ocular tilt reaction is depicted schematically on the right in relation to the level of the lesion (i.e., ipsiversive with peripheral and pontomedul-lary lesions, and a contraversive with pontomesencephaliclesions). In vestibular thalamus lesions, the tilts of the subjective visual vertical may be contraversive or ipsiver- sive.

Brodsky. 2006,"With this disturbance, the patient’s sub- jective sense of true vertical is rotated in the samedirection as the ocular torsion, suggesting that thetilted perception of vertical provides the drivingforce for all components of the ocular tilt reaction,which strives to realign the eyes and body with theperceived vertical. This mechanism for torticollisdiffers from the more common contralateral head tilt in superior oblique palsy, which recruits otolithic innervation to restore vertical ocular alignment, allthree components of the ocular tilt reaction realignthe eyes and head to the tilted perception of true vertical . In the ocular tilt reaction, correction of the verticalocular misalignment by prisms or by strabismussurgery should not eliminate the torticollis. Following vestibular stimulation, some patients with skew deviation may experience a room-tilt illusion in which a room is perceived to be tilted onits side or even upside down. 199Slavin and LoPinto178described an exceptional patient who experienced subjective visual tilt. Examination dis-closed a bilateral rightward cyclodeviation anda corresponding tilt in the subjective visual vertical,but no hypertropia or head tilt in this patient who had compression of the left lateral medulla by a dolichoectatic carotid artery. These ﬁndings wereconsistent with a partial ocular tilt reaction (withoutskew deviation). Conversely, Strupp et al recentlydescribed a patient with unilateral anterior semi-circular canal dehiscence who experienced oculartorsion but no displacement of the subjective visualvertical, suggesting that subjective visual tilt specif- ically requires asymmetrical otolithic input. 189 To examine the effect of unilateral brainstem injury on perception of vertical in the roll plane,Dieterich and Brandt examined ocular torsion andtilt in the subjective visual vertical in 111 patientswith acute vascular brainstem stroke. 61Of these patients, 104 (94%) showed a direction speciﬁcpathologic tilt of the static subjective visual vertical. Seventy-one of 86 patients (83%) exhibited a path- ological static ocular torsion of one (47%) or both(36%) eyes. The tilt in the subjective visual verticaland ocular torsion were generally in the samedirection."
Brodsky. 2006,"Caudal brainstem lesions caused ipsiver-sive tilts of the subjective visual vertical, whereasupper brainstem lesions caused contraversive tilts.Tilts in the subjective visual vertical were greatest with mesodiencephalic lesions and with lateral medullary lesions (i.e., Wallenberg syndrome). Themean tilt angle was 8.1 degrees, with a range of 2 to26 degrees. All lesions caudal to the upper ponscaused ipsiversive ocular torsion of one or both eyes,with concurrent ipsiversive tilts of the subjectivevisual vertical, whereas all lesions rostral to thispontine level cause contraversive tilts of oculartorsion and the subjective visual vertical. Some patients had signiﬁcant tilts of the subjective visualvertical but no concurrent ocular torsion. Whenocular torsion was present, it was always accompa-nied by a tilt of the subjective visual vertical in thesame direction. The quantitative dissociation be-tween a tilt in the subjective visual vertical and thecorresponding ocular torsion shows that deviations in the subjective visual vertical are not simply the sensory consequence of the rotation of the eye, butrepresent the perceptual correlate of a vestibulartone imbalance in the roll plane. 61Some patients with brainstem injury can also experience brief,episodic tilting of the visual world as an apparentlyisolated phenomenon. 163 In addition to brainstem injury, acute peripheral vestibular loss can also cause an ipsiversive tilt of the subjective visual vertical and ocular torsion, asshown by Friedman following labyrinthectomy, 75 and by Curthoys following unilateral vestibularneurectomy. 52Curthoys et al found a high correla- tion between the direction and magnitude ofchanges in ocular torsion and the subjective visualvertical one week after unilateral vestibular neurec- tomy in many patients, 52suggesting that peripheral lesions cause a tilt of the subjective visual verticalwith an ocular torsion of similar magnitude while, incentral vestibular lesions, the magnitude of theeffect on these two parameters may differ, witha tendency of the subjective visual vertical to beaffected to a greater degree. VIII. Localizing Value To ascertain the localizing value of skew deviation,"
Brodsky. 2006,"Brandt and Dieterich reviewed 155 patients with theclinical diagnosis of acute unilateral brainsteminfarction. 26Fifty-six (36%) of these patients dem- onstrated skew deviation. Skew deviation was alwaysassociated with ocular torsion, which affected botheyes in 50%, the lowermost eye in 31%, and the uppermost eye in 19%. The direction of the ocular torsion inevitably corresponded to the direction ofskew (i.e., intorsion of the right eye and/orextorsion of the left eye with a left hypotropia, andintorsion of the left eye and extorsion of the righteye with a right hypotropia). Skew deviation wasassociated with a complete ocular tilt reactiontoward the lowermost eye in 61%. In all cases, unilateral pontomedullary lesions induced ipsiver- sive skew deviations (toward the side of the lowereye) which were probably caused by injury to themedial or superior vestibular nucleus, while unilat-eral pontomesencephalic and mesodiencephaliclesions all caused contraversive skew deviations,probably from involvement of the interstitialSKEW DEVIATION REVISITED 111 nucleus of Cajal in the rostral midbrain tegmentum or the medial longitudinal fasciculus along itspontomesencephalic route. These ﬁndings con-ﬁrmed that skew deviation usually occurs as a com-ponent of the ocular tilt reaction. It also identiﬁedthe localizing value of skew deviation in patientswith acute brainstem infarction. If the level ofbrainstem damage is known from the clinical syndrome, then skew deviation indicates the side of the lesion. Conversely, if the side of the lesion isevident from the clinical syndrome, then the level ofthe brainstem injury is indicated by the direction ofskew, ipsiversive with caudal and contraversive withrostral brainstem lesions. 26 From these studies,26the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. The clinical signs, both perceptual and motor, of a vestibular tone imbalance in the roll planeare ocular tilt reaction, ocular torsion, skewdeviation, and tilts of the perceived visual vertical. 2."
Brodsky. 2006,"Either a complete ocular tilt reaction (OTR) or a skew deviation (as one component of theocular tilt reaction) indicates a unilateral pe-ripheral deﬁcit of otolith input or a unilaterallesion of graviceptive brainstem pathways fromthe vestibular nuclei (crossing the midline atthe pontine level) to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal in the rostral midbrain. 3. All tilt effects—perceptual, ocular motor, and postural—are ipsiversive (ipsilateral eye under-most) with unilateral peripheral or pontome-dullary lesions below the crossing of thegraviceptive pathways. 4. All tilt effects are contraversive (contralateral eye undermost) with unilateral pontomesence- phalic brainstem lesions. Contraversive tilt effects indicate involvement of the mediallongitudinal fasciculus or the rostral midbrain(interstitial nucleus of Cajal). IX. Sites of Injury The ocular tilt reaction indicates a unilateral peripheral deﬁcit of otolithic input or a unilaterallesion of graviceptive brainstem pathways from thevestibular nucleus (crossing midline at the pontinelevel) to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal in the rostral midbrain. 25The resultant head tilt, torsion of the eyes, skew deviation, and tilt of the subjectivevisual vertical are the postural, ocular motor, andperceptual manifestations of a single lesion of thosevestibular pathways subserving the vestibulo-ocularreﬂex in the roll plane. 25Because these pathways are difﬁcult to injure in isolation, lesions along eachsite of the vestibulo-ocular pathways may be associ- ated with speciﬁc clinical disorders depending ontheir location which determine the contiguous areasof injury. Lesions causing the ocular tilt reaction canbe subdivided in to peripheral and central injuriesto the otolithic pathways. A. PERIPHERAL INJURY TO OTOLITHIC PATHWAYS 1. Utricle In the cat, stimulation of one utricular nerve produces conjugate ocular torsion and vertical skewing of the eyes.191In humans, inadvertent damage to one utricle52,90,91or lesions of the human labyrinth91and vestibular nerve produce a tonic"
Brodsky. 2006,"ipsiversive ocular tilt reaction.53In rare patients with Tullio phenomenon (sound-induced nystagmus),acoustic stimulation of one labyrinth can producea controversive ocular tilt reaction. 31,54,65Brandt et al described a sound-induced ocular tilt reaction (Tullio phenomenon) in a professional horn playerwho complained about distressing attacks of oscil-lopsia as well as postural imbalance elicited by loudsounds applied to the involved ear. 31Surgical exploration of the middle ear revealed a subluxatedstapes footplate with the hypertrophic stapediusmuscle causing pathologically large amplitude movements during the stapedius reﬂex, compress- ing the adjacent utricle. 2. Vestibular Nerve A phasic (i.e., paroxysmal) contraversive OTR is produced in the cat by electrical stimulation of oneutricular nerve. 191In humans, skew deviation can result from chronic nonsuppurative otitis media,19 peripheral vestibular neurectomy, labyrinthectomy, stapedectomy complicated by an otolithic dysfunc- tion,89,92,166,209--211vestibular neuritis,167,208,209and vestibuloacoustic nerve surgery.161,209,219In this setting, skew deviation generally disappears withinseveral days while the conjugate cyclotorsion andtilting of the static visual vertical may persist for weeksto months. 208,209Skew deviation is also seen in cochleo-vestibular loss (viral labyrinthitis),210and vestibular neuritis.166,167Tiliket et al induced a room tilt illusion by vestibular stimulation in three patientswith skew deviations, suggesting that this symptomresults from a perceptual manifestation of a dynamicmismatch between the inappropriate otolith inputsand the correct visual inputs. 199 B.

Some patients experiencea room tilt illusion, in which the entire room is tiltedon its side or even upside down. 33,105The disorder is usually caused by occlusion of the intradural segment of the ipsilateral vertebral artery, or occlusion of the perforating branches which s upply the dorsolateral medulla and cause injury to the vestibular nucleusor its cerebellar, semicircular canal, or otolithicconnections. In patients with lateral medullary infarction, the ocular torsion is usually unequal, with greaterextorsion of the ipsilateral eye than incyclotorsion of the contralateral eye. 79,90In a study of 36 patients with Wallenberg syndrome, Dieterich and Brandt63 noted ipsiversive cyclorotation of one or both eyes inmost patients, especially extorsion of the eyeipsilateral to the brainstem lesion (suggesting anisolated lesion of posterior canal pathways) ( Fig. 7 ). Only one third of patients had a complete ocular tiltreaction but all patients had a tilt of the subjective visual vertical. 28,139Torsional nystagmus is also common in Wallenberg syndrome, with the upperpoles of the eyes beating away from the side of thelesion. 33In Wallenberg syndrome, the deviation in the subjective visual vertical, lateropulsion of thebody, and cyclorotation of the eyes are the percep-tual, ocular motor, and postural consequences ofa common lesion of central vestibulo-ocular path- ways that subserve graviceptive tone in the roll plane. 33The disconjugate ocular torsion in this"
Brodsky. 2006,"syndrome presumably reﬂects selective injury tootolithic pathways corresponding to the posteriorsemicircular canals. 23,29,33Medial medullary lesions that cause skew deviation can be associated withupbeating nystagmus. 142 2. Cerebellum Otolith input to the cerebellum has been dem- onstrated extensively.10,42,47,83Animal studies have demonstrated pathways not only from the vestibularnuclei via the inferior olive to the cerebellar vermis(uvula-nodulus), but also primary otolith projec-tions to the uvula-nodulus via mossy ﬁbers. 11Furthermore, single-cell recordings suggest that the otoliths inﬂuence neural activity in the rostral fastigial nucleus.42The otolith signals are relayed from the vestibular nuclei, medullary reticularformation, inferior olive, and lateral reticularnucleus to the cerebellar nodulus and uvula, andinﬂuence the deep cerebellar nucleus. 42Skew deviation has been produced experimentally inanimals by lesions of the cerebellum, 104,149,217resti- form body,212and inferior and middle cerebellar peduncle.2,44,149Burde and colleagues found lateral alternating skew deviation in two monkeys after totalcerebellectomy; 41however, most studies of ocular motor function following stimulation or destructionof the cerebellum in humans 116,145and mon- keys47,162,218have not noted skew deviation. Because early reports of skew deviation in humans were so frequently associated with large cerebellar Fig. 7.

These asymmetric injuries provide an explanation for incomitantforms of skew deviation.SKEW DEVIATION REVISITED 113 lesions,41,103,153,181,207it is curious that the causal association of skew deviation with cerebellar diseasehas been a matter of some controversy. As discussedbelow, lateral alternating skew deviation (resultingfrom bilateral injury to the vestibulo-oculartracts) 140,141,207,224is recognized in patients with"
Brodsky. 2006,"Arnold Chiari malformation and other types ofcerebellar disease, but clinical reports of unilateral skew deviation in patients with pure cerebellar disease are surprisingly rare. 140In retrospect, most cerebellar lesions purported to cause skew deviationwith comitant hypertropia have been large, 181and have probably involved adjacent brainstem vestibulo-ocular pathways, and this was the cause of theobserved skew deviation. 115,157 Recent evidence has conﬁrmed that isolated cerebellar lesions can indeed cause skew deviation. Mossman and Halmagyi documented two patientswith tonic contraversive partial ocular tilt reactionsattributable to unilateral cerebellar lesions. Radtkedescribed paroxysmal alternating skew deviation ina patient who underwent biopsy of the inferiorcerebellar vermis resulting in destruction of theuvula. The localization of these lesions suggested that the ocular tilt reaction may be under inhibitory control of the ipsilateral caudal cerebellum. 140 Wong and Sharpe described ﬁve patients withprobable skew deviations caused by focal cerebellarlesions involving the vermis or hemisphere. 220 3. Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus Because focal lesions of the medial longitudinal fasciculus can also produce an ocular tilt reaction, careful examination for skew deviation is especiallyimportant in patients with demyelinating disease. 225 When skew deviation accompanies internuclearophthalmoplegia, the higher eye is usually on theaffected side, suggesting a rostral lesion of themedial longitudinal fasciculus after it crosses inthe pons. 84,182Patients with an unilateral internu- clear ophthalmoplegia should also be examined for ocular torsion and a head tilt to the contralateralside. 46,180,200,225In a retrospective series, Smith et al identiﬁed skew deviation in 43% of patients withunilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (mostlysecondary to ischemic vascular disease) and in13% of patients with bilateral internuclear ophthal-moplegia (mostly secondary to multiple sclero- sis). 182In 10 of 12 unilateral cases, the higher eye was on the side of the MLF lesion. Patients with unilateral internuclear ophthalmo-"
Brodsky. 2006,"plegia may also have a conjugate torsional nystag-mus in which the upper poles of the eyes cyclorotateso as to beat toward the side of the lesion. 55When internuclear ophthalmoplegia is associated withdiplopia, it is often incorrectly assumed that the diplopia is horizontal secondary to deﬁcient adduc-tion. In this setting, a patient may have a clinicallynonevident skew deviation that is sufﬁcient toprevent fusion. Placement of a small vertical prismmay be all that is necessary to relieve the diplopiaand restore binocular vision. 4. Midbrain It was noted long ago that skew deviation can be produced in monkeys by unilateral electrolyticlesions in the midbrain tegmentum. 58In experi- mental animals, electrical stimulation of the meso-diencephalon in the region of the interstitialnucleus of Cajal elicits a phasic (i.e., transient)ipsiversive head tilt and eye torsion, whereas lesions in the region of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal produce tonic (i.e., persistent) contraversive headtilt and eye torsion. 3,70,89,96,101,102,109--111,130,201Elec- trical stimulation in the region of the INC producesa phasic ipsiversive OTR. 77,78,96,129,169Patients with unilateral stereotactic midbrain lesions have alsodeveloped skew deviation. 144 In humans, mesodiencephalic lesions involving the interstitial nucleus of Cajal produce an ocular tilt reaction that is contraversive if the lesion isinhibitory and ipsiversive and paroxysmal if thelesion is excitatory. 89The interstitial nucleus of Cajal is the most rostral midbrain structure inwhich a unilateral lesion induces the ocular tiltreaction or skew deviation. 25It is an important structure in the control of vertical and torsional head and eye position,193and an essential compo- nent of the neural (velocity-to-position) integratorfor both vertical and torsional eye move-ments. 3,4,25,51,77,99,117 The current functional concept is that there are"
Brodsky. 2006,"two distinct and separate brainstem structurescontrolling eye--head coordination in roll and pitch:the bilateral caudal vestibulo-ocular reﬂex with inputs from the otoliths and the vertical semi- circular canals, and the bilateral rostral integrationcenter (the interstitial nucleus of Cajal). If theascending medullary graviceptive pathways arelesioned at the pontomesencephalic level, rostralto the downward branching of the vestibulo-spinaltracts, skew deviation and ocular torsion can occur inthe absence of a head tilt. 23This mechanism explains some partial forms of ocular tilt reaction that are seen. Other mesencephalic lesions selectively affectdescending pathways for eye--head coordination andproduce a complete ocular tilt reaction with conju-gate ocular torsion. These lesions involve descendingpathways such as the tectoreticulospinal neurons thatoriginate in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal and run114 Surv Ophthalmol 51 (2) March--April 2006 BRODSKY ET AL through the medial longitudinal fasciculus to couple eye and head roll motion by excitatory projections. When skew is accompanied by dorsal midbrain syndrome the lesion can be localized to the mesen-cephalon. 50,89,148,159,168,180,213Medially situated or bilateral midbrain lesions can produce lateral alter-nating skew deviation. 118,164,165Because the half cycles of see-saw nystagmus are identical to the eye movement abnormalities of the ocular tilt reaction,92 it is not surprising that jerk see-saw nystagmus and the ocular tilt reaction sometimes occur concomitantly inpatients with midbrain lesions involving the intersti-tial nucleus of Cajal. 14,88,92,159Rambold et al de- scribed a patient with congenital nystagmus whodeveloped intermittent see-saw nystagmus with visi-ble head oscillations that were synchronized to the nystagmus, suggesting a common oscillating signal for the generation of head and eye movements. 159"
Brodsky. 2006,"Unilateral mesodiencephalic lesions that activate therostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinalfasciculus can produce an ocular tilt reaction or a jerksee-saw nystagmus with torsional fast phases thatrotate the upper poles of the eyes toward the side ofthe lesion. 14,88 5. Thalamus Reports of skew deviation in patients with thalamic injury reﬂect injury to subthalamic structures.71,121 Ischemic lesions involving the interstitial nucleus ofCajal often occur in association with paramedianthalamic infarctions. When a skew deviation occursin association with pretectal extension of a thalamic hemorrhage, the higher eye is usually ipsilateral. 72 Kumral et al found skew deviation in 17 of 55 (31%) patients with posterior thalamic hemorrhage, 14 ofwho had a large thalamic hemorrhage. 120 In 1993, Brandt and Dieterich examined 35 patients with acute thalamic infarctions and foundthat 8 of 14 patients with paramedian infarctionshad a complete ocular tilt reaction. 60The ocular tilt reaction in these patients was due to ischemia of the rostal midbrain tegmentum (including the intersti-tial nucleus of Cajal) and not to thalamic injury perse. Eleven of 17 patients with posterolateral in-farctions of the thalamic nuclei exhibited tilts of thesubjective visual vertical that were either ipsiversiveor contraversive. Anteromedial infarctions did notaffect vestibular function in the roll plane. These results indicate that the interstitial nucleus of Cajal and the rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF arethe most rostral brainstem structures mediatingeye-head coordination in roll. 60Unilateral lesions of vestibular structures rostral to the interstitialnucleus of Cajal manifest with deviations of per-ceived vertical without concurrent eye-head tilt. 25,606. Vestibular Cortex Unilateral lesions of vestibular structures rostral to the INC (i.e., the vestibular thalamus and vestibular cortex) cause mostly contraversive tilts in the subjective visual vertical without concurrent eye-head tilt. 22,25Tilts in the subjective visual vertical"
Brodsky. 2006,"caused by lesions in the vestibular cortex may beassociated with a compulsory lateropulsion. 22The overlapping areas of infarction centered on theposterior insula, suggesting that the parieto-insularvestibular cortex seems to represent the integration center of the multisensory vestibular cortex areas within the parietal lobe. 30 X. Clinical Subtypes Smith et al divided skew deviation into three classic subtypes (comitant, laterally comitant, andlateral alternating skew deviation). 181Additional forms such as paroxysmal skew deviation, alternat-ing skew deviation, and transient neonatal skew have since been recognized. A. COMITANT SKEW DEVIATION Most cases of skew deviation are comitant ,44,182 meaning that the size of the hyperdeviation remains about the same in each ﬁeld of gaze.44Comitant skew deviation arises from a lesion that knocks outunilateral otolithic input corresponding to pathwaysof the anterior and posterior semicircular canals toequal degrees. 25,28Consider a left-sided utricular lesion, which would produce a right hypertropia by stimulating the right superior oblique and superior rectus muscles and the left inferior oblique and theleft inferior rectus muscles. In right gaze, the rightsuperior rectus and left inferior rectus activationwould produce a right hypertropia that would bereduced slightly by the vertical action of theactivated left inferior oblique muscle. In left gaze,the same muscles would produce a hypertropia that would be reduced slightly by the vertical action of the activated right superior oblique muscle. Thus,the skew deviation would remain relatively comitantin different horizontal positions of gaze. Thebinocular torsion would be produced by therelatively greater oblique muscle contribution tocyclorotation in each eye. It is more difﬁcult to explain why a comitant skew deviation is generally associated with a negative Bielschowsky Head Tilt test. 7,165In skew deviation with a right hypertropia, for example, tilting thehead to the right would stimulate the right otolith toactivate the right superior rectus and superioroblique muscles and the left inferior rectus andinferior oblique muscles."
Brodsky. 2006,"Because the vertical rectusSKEW DEVIATION REVISITED 115 muscles have a stronger vertical action, this maneu- ver should slightly increase the size of the verticaldeviation. Conversely, a left head tilt would activatethe right inferior rectus and inferior obliquemuscles and the left superior rectus and superioroblique muscles, and thereby reduce the existingvertical deviation. In skew deviation, this effect isminimal, perhaps because these muscles are more or less fully recruited by disinhibition from the lesioned left utricular system. B. INCOMITANT SKEW DEVIATION Some forms of skew deviation may be greater in one horizontal ﬁeld of gaze and minimal in theopposite ﬁeld of gaze. 84,181Smith et al dubbed this form of skew deviation laterally comitant meaning that, in each lateral ﬁeld of gaze, the deviation remains fairly comitant whether the patient islooking up or down. 182Because the hyperdeviation is greater in one lateral ﬁeld of gaze than the other,this form of skew deviation is actually incomitant. Insuch cases, prism alternate cover testing maydisclose only a residual hyperphoria in the normalﬁeld of gaze, although small tropias are often present. In our experience, a large vertical deviation in one lateral ﬁeld of gaze with no vertical deviationin the contralateral ﬁeld of gaze may often be a signof isolated or associated oblique muscle palsy, andshould be accompanied by a positive BielschowskyHead Tilt test and a corresponding extorsion of thehypertropic eye. Incomitant skew deviation may arise from asym- metric injury to otolithic pathways corresponding to either the anterior or posterior canals are selectivelyinjured. 68Using known vestibulo-ocular connec- tions, the examiner can often postulate whichpathways have been injured ( Fig. 7 ). Consider, for example, a lesion that selectively injures theotolithic projections corresponding to the leftanterior semicircular canal (which excite the left superior rectus and right inferior oblique muscles, and inhibit the left inferior rectus and right superioroblique muscles). In left gaze, the hyperdeviationwill be fairly minimal, because the action of both ofthese elevators is diminished."
Brodsky. 2006,"In right gaze, thevertical effect of the weak right inferior obliquemuscle is minimal while the inhibited left superiorrectus muscle (which is still the main elevator) will produce a right hypertropia, causing the eyes to skew in right gaze. Thus, if the lesion is known fromassociated clinical ﬁndings or neuroimaging to beon the left side, the examiner can infer that theotolithic pathways corresponding to the anteriorcanal are selectively injured. Conversely, injury tothe left posterior canal pathways would inhibit theleft superior oblique and right inferior rectus muscles. Because both depressors have a strongvertical action in right gaze there would be minimalvertical deviation in this position of gaze. In leftgaze, however, the left superior oblique has minimalvertical action while the right inferior rectus muscleis still the major depressor. Thus, inhibiting bothmuscles will result in a right hypertropia in left gaze, causing the eyes to skew apart in left gaze. C. PAROXYSMAL (INTERMITTENT) SKEW DEVIATION Whereas a tonic ocular tilt reaction is due to a decrease in tonic neural activity, a phasic (i.e.,paroxysmal or intermittent ) ocular tilt reaction is due to a transient lesion-induced increase in neural activity. 89Tilt effects caused by paroxysmal activa- tion are opposite in direction to those caused bylesional inhibition such as unilateral infarc-tion. 24,89,98,129,156Most reports of paroxysmal skew deviation have involved patients with irritative mid-brain lesions. Intermittent forms of skew deviationin which one eye drifts up episodically have been documented in other patients with irritative mid- brain lesions. 87,115Hedges and Hoyt described a patient who experienced episodes of contralateralhypertropia and head tilt due to a lesion close to theright interstitial nucleus of Cajal. 98The paroxysmal head tilt and vertical divergence were coupled totonic conjugate torsional movements of the eyes,suggesting an irritative mechanism. Paroxysmal skew deviation can also be a feature of"

These patients wereunusual in that they exhibited fast phase movementsin the direction of the ocular tilt reaction. 14In one patient, the abnormal eye movements were tempo-rally linked to dystonic movements in the limbs onthe side opposite the brainstem lesion. 14116 Surv Ophthalmol 51 (2) March--April 2006 BRODSKY ET AL D. PERIODIC OR SLOWLY ALTERNATING SKEW DEVIATION Numerous patients have been described with slowly alternating skew deviation or, less commonly, periodic alternating skew deviation that alternates or varies in magnitude over the course of a fewminutes. 50,137The great majority have been attribut- able to midbrain lesions.116Most of these cases had no documented torsion or head tilt. However, somehad intorsion of the higher eye and extorsion of thelower eye, suggesting a pathophysiologic overlap with seesaw nystagmus.

LATERAL ALTERNATING SKEW DEVIATION Lateral alternating skew deviation refers to a re- versing hypertropia that is present in each lateralposition of gaze. Most commonly the abducting eyeis higher but sometimes the adducting eye can behigher. 115,141It has long been suspected that laterally alternating skew deviation results frombilateral rather than unilateral involvement ofcentral otolithic pathways. 24,84,115,116,144Only re- cently, however, has evidence accumulated to explain the speciﬁc ocular motor effects of bilateralbrainstem lesions. Cogan ﬁrst reported bilateral abduction hyper- tropia in a patient with downbeating nystagmus andbasilar invagination. 45In 1985, Keane examined 408 patients with skew deviation and found that 47(12%) had a skew deviation that alternated on gaze to either side. 115Pretectal lesions were responsible for 29 cases and lower brainstem lesions were seen in5 cases. Acute hydrocephalus, tumors, strokes, andmultiple sclerosis were the most common causes,followed by spinocerebellar disease and tectalherniation. In 23 patients the adducting eye washigher, in 22 it was lower, and in 2 it reversed onrepeat examination. This suggested that bilateral alternating skew deviation may localize to thepretectal area. 115In 1988, Moster et al described 53 patients with alternating skew deviation in lateralgaze with hypertropia of the abducting eye. 141Most"
Brodsky. 2006,"patients had associated downbeating nystagmus andataxia and were diagnosed as having lesions of thecraniocervical junction. The localization of these lesions contrasted sharply with those in Keane’s report, where lesions were found mainly in themidbrain pretectum. It is now established thatlateral alternating skew deviation results from bi-lateral injury to central graviceptive pathways whichextend from the medulla to the midbrain. 24Because these pathways can be injured at any point alongtheir course, it should be expected that bilateral lesions at many positions along the brainstem can produce this ocular motility disorder. 24 In 1995, Brandt and Dieterich suggested that overlapping pathways modulate roll and pitchfunction of the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex, makingefﬁcient use of the vestibular network. 24According to their hypothesis, a unilateral skew deviationreﬂects a central graviceptive imbalance in the roll plane, while bilateral paramedian lesions or bilateral dysfunction of the cerebellar ﬂocculus producesa tone imbalance in the pitch plane. The principlebehind this operation resembles the guidancesystem of airplanes, in which unilateral activationof a brake ﬂap causes the plane to roll but bilateralactivation results in downward pitch. In a bilateralocular tilt reaction, the vertical components sum- mate to produce the slow phase vertical drift of both eyes while the torsional components cancel eachother. Thus, a unilateral roll imbalance manifests asan ocular tilt reaction, while bilateral otolithicimbalance produces vertical nystagmus in conjunc-tion with an alternating skew on lateral gaze. 24 Because central otolithic pathways corresponding to the anterior and posterior semicircular canals (which subserve forward and backward body pitch) are segregated in the brainstem, the clinicalcharacteristics of bilateral alternating skew devia-tion may simply reﬂect the pattern of injury to thesepathways. A bilateral neurologic lesion that selec-tively inhibits those otolithic pathways correspond-ing to the anterior semicircular canals would lead toa predominance of output from otolithic pathways corresponding to the posterior semicircular canals (Fig. 8 ). 24Brandt and Dieterich coined the term posterior canal predominance for this type of central"
Brodsky. 2006,"vestibular imbalance, which would increase tonus tothe inferior rectus and superior oblique musclesof both eyes. 67Because the vertical action of the superior oblique muscles is more prominentin adduction, the abducting eye would displaySKEW DEVIATION REVISITED 117 a hypertropia on gaze to either side ( Fig. 8 ). A recent evolutionary hypothesis by Zee similarly invokes the innervational effects of body pitch during lateralgaze in lateral eyed animals to similarly explain whylateral alternating skew deviation could result froma central pitch imbalance. 224 F. TRANSIENT NEONATAL SKEW DEVIATION Hoyt et al found skew deviation in 22 neonates with no other signs of brainstem dysfunction.108The skew deviation resolved by 3 days of age in 15 cases.Five infants subsequently developed congenitalesotropia. The authors emphasized that neonatal skew deviation may be a precursor of congenital esotropia, and that some of these infants may havehad dissociated vertical divergence. XI. Differential Diagnosis A. GENERAL Skew deviation and its associated ocular tilt reaction are usually readily differentiated from thevertical ocular misalignment caused by restriction(blow out fracture, congenital ﬁbrosis syndrome,Brown syndrome, orbital ﬁbrous bands, pareticdisease—some forms of double elevator palsy,superior or inferior division third nerve palsy,etc.), neuromuscular junction disease (myasthenia gravis), innervational disorders (dissociated verticaldivergence), and rare disorders such as extraocularmuscle aplasia 1,32,183(Table 1 ). In the patient with acute neurologic disease, however, the prenuclearocular tilt reaction must be carefully distinguishedfrom nuclear or peripheral oculomotor and troch-lear lesions, especially when the midbrain tegmen- tum is involved. 62,150In a cranial nerve palsy, any perceived tilt in the subjective visual vertical issecondary to the ocular torsion, whereas in theocular tilt reaction, the ocular torsion is secondaryto the subjective visual tilt (or both may besecondary to the underlying central vestibulardisturbance)."
Brodsky. 2006,"Unilateral oculomotor or trochlearpalsy should be suspected when ocular torsion and tilt in the subjective visual vertical are measurable in one eye only. 62In bilateral fourth nerve palsy, monocular measurements show subjective visualtilts for both eyes in opposite directions. 25A prenuclear tegmental lesion can rarely injure thecranial nerve nucleus or nerve fascicle and producea combined prenuclear and fascicular lesion, 62 resulting in a skew deviation plus an oblique muscle palsy. These disorders produce complicated ocular motility ﬁndings depending upon the relativedamage to each structure. B.

In this setting, the positive Bielschowsky Head Tilt test andthe ocular torsion, as measured by fundus observa-tion, must be used to distinguish the two disorders(Table 2 ). In 1999, Donahue et al described 5 patients with hypertropia and contralateral head tilt, in whom theBielschowsky Head Tilt test suggested superior oblique palsy 68(Fig. 9 ). Although extorsion of the higher eye characterizes superior oblique palsy,these patients had extorsion of the lower eye and/or intorsion of the higher eye, indicating an oculartilt reaction. All patients had other neurologicfeatures consistent with more widespread brainstemdisease. The authors interpreted the ﬁndings fromthe three-step test to be indicative of selective injury to the otolithic pathways corresponding to the anterior semicircular canals, and cautioned thatexamination of objective fundus torsion in both eyesis necessary to rule out an ocular tilt reaction anddifferentiate the incomitant hypertropia of apparentsuperior oblique palsy from skew deviation. Me-chanical anomalies within the orbital pulley system(a lower lateral rectus muscle pulley on one side) can also manifest as unilateral superior oblique palsy. 57 C. SKEW DEVIATION SIMULATING INFERIOR OBLIQUE MUSCLE PALSY"
Brodsky. 2006,"In 2001, Donahue et al described 5 patients with ocular motility disorders and Bielschowsky Head Tilttests suggestive of inferior oblique palsy. 69All had associated neurologic disease referable to theposterior fossa. Five patients had extorsion of the lower eye and four had intorsion of the higher eye. The authors concluded that an ocular tilt reaction can simulate inferior oblique palsy when otolithicpathways corresponding to the posterior semicircu-lar canal pathways on the side of the hypotropic eyeare selectively injured. Because the original papersdescribing isolated inferior oblique muscle paralysisdid not directly measure ocular torsion, 154,173some previously reported cases of isolated inferior oblique muscle overaction may have actually represented skew deviation. D. SKEW DEVIATION ACCOMPANYING SIXTH NERVE PALSY Patients with sixth nerve palsy may present with a small coexistent hyperdeviation which may beattributable to physiologic hyperphoria (probablydissociated vertical divergence), superior obliquepalsy, or skew deviation. In 1989, Slavin examined 16patients with isolated unilateral sixth nerve palsyusing Maddox rods, and found that a large amountTABLE 2 Ocular Tilt Reaction Versus Superior Oblique Palsy Prenuclear Lesion (Ocular Tilt Reaction) Superior Oblique Palsy Intorsion of higher eye/ extorsion of the lowereyeExtorsion of higher eye Binocular tilt of subjective visualverticalMonocular tilt of subjective visual vertical Head tilt compensatory for altered subjective visual verticalHead tilt compensatory for vertical diplopia Fig. 9.

Brodsky. 2006,"SKEW DEVIATION REVISITED 119 of hyperdeviation, up to 16 prism diopters, could be detected in these patients in different gaze positionsas well as in head tilt. 177Wong et al recently examined 20 patients with unilateral sixth nervepalsy with scleral search coil recordings and foundthat 75% had a vertical deviation in at least one eyeposition. 221They found that patients with periph- eral palsies had greater hyperdeviations of the eye ipsilateral to the tilt (suggesting possible disinhibi- tion of otolith-ocular reﬂexes by loss of binocularvision). Conversely, patients with central palsiesmaintained the same hypertropia on tilt to eitherside (suggesting unilateral injury to otolith-ocularpathways leading to skew deviation). XII. Expanding the Deﬁnition of Skew Deviation Our traditional application of the term skew deviation to patients with neurologic disease leaves us with a hemianopic view of this disorder and its underlying physiology. In lower animals, the centralvestibular system uses weighted graviceptive inputfrom the two labyrinths and weighted visual inputfrom the two eyes to establish subjective verticalorientation in the roll and pitch plane. 38These primitive reﬂexes can be detected in normalhumans, wherein a cycloversion movement (a conjugate torsional rotation of both eyes as occurs in the ocular tilt reaction) is evoked by visual orgraviceptive imbalance in the roll plane, whilea cyclovergence movement (a disconjugate torsionalrotation of both eyes resulting in intorsion orextorsion of both eyes) is evoked by a visual orgraviceptive imbalance in the pitch plane. 35Al- though the binocular visual system is normally subordinate to the peripheral vestibular system in establishing extraocular muscle tone, these primi-tive reﬂexes manifest in the setting of congenitalstrabismus. 38Thus, a unilateral or asymmetrical loss of otolithic tone secondary to brainstem, cerebellar,or utricular injury causes a skew deviation, whileasymmetrical visual input in the setting of congen-ital strabismus evokes dissociated vertical diver- gence."
Brodsky. 2006,"36,37The same interrelationship is evident in the pitch plane, where a bilateral loss of otolithictone causes lateral alternating skew deviation whileasymmetrical visual input can produce primaryinferior oblique muscle overaction. 35,38 A. DISSOCIATED VERTICAL DIVERGENCE Dissociated vertical divergence (DVD) is an ocular motor disorder characterized by a slow upward driftof either eye, followed, after a variable period oftime, by a slow descent of the higher eye back to theneutral position ( Fig. 10 ). The hyperdeviating eye extorts during its ascent and intorts as it descends toresume ﬁxation. Dissociated vertical divergencemost commonly accompanies congenital esotropia,but is also seen with rarer forms of congenitalstrabismus. 37 Dissociated vertical divergence recapitulates the primitive dorsal light reﬂex, wherein asymmetrical visual input to the two eyes evokes a vertical divergence movement.37Like the otolithic ocular tilt reaction, this visuo-vestibular reﬂex also func-tions as a righting reﬂex in lateral-eyed animals torestore vertical orientation by equalizing visual inputto the two eyes. 37Brodsky has proposed that dissociated vertical divergence is a human dorsallight reﬂex, which is normally suppressed except when early onset strabismus precludes the develop- ment of single binocular vision in infancy(Fig. 10 ). 36,37In this setting, the two eyes revert to their primitive ancestral function as sensory balance Fig. 10. Dissociated vertical divergence. In the patient with congenital strabismus, unequal binocular visual input exerts the same physiologic effect as unbalanced utricular input, producing a combined vertical divergence andcycloversion of the eyes. In DVD, however, the cyclo- version movement is opposite in direction to that seen with the utricular ocular tilt reaction. (Reprinted fromBrodsky 36with permission of the American Medical Association.)120 Surv Ophthalmol 51 (2) March--April 2006 BRODSKY ET AL organs. Dissociated vertical divergence appears to be"
Brodsky. 2006,"a second type of ocular tilt reaction that producesa vertical divergence with intorsion of the lower eyeand extorsion of the higher eye. 37This vertical divergence can be conceptualized as an inverse skewdeviation that is driven by unequal visual input tothe two eyes rather than unequal graviceptive inputto the two labyrinths. 37Vertical divergence of the eyes with these inverse torsional characteristics seems to be a signature of abnormal binocularvision. 37Dissociated vertical divergence may also contribute to the physiologic hyperphoria that isevoked in normal individuals by occlusion orMaddox rod testing. 127,147,179 B. PRIMARY OBLIQUE MUSCLE OVERACTION Central vestibular mechanisms that are operative in the pitch plane may explain the clinical overlapbetween primary oblique muscle overaction andlateral alternating skew deviation. 25,35,38,67By view- ing a pencil slanted forward or backward in thepitch plane, then closing one eye and the other, thereader can see that each image appears tilted inopposite directions when viewed monocularly. Thus, the monocular correlate of slant is disconjugate tilt. 35In the same way that a roll plane imbalance evokes an ocular tilt reaction, a pitch planeimbalance evokes a compensatory cyclovergence ofthe eyes. In the setting of congenital strabismus, thiscompensatory cyclovergence manifests as primaryoblique muscle overaction. 35 Like DVD, primary inferior oblique overaction generally accompanies congenital strabismus.38Pri- mary inferior oblique overaction corresponds toa forward pitch imbalance. 38Conversely, structural neurologic disease within the brainstem or cerebel-lum produces the intorsion and superior obliquemuscle overaction so commonly seen in childrenwith Chiari malformations, meningomyelocele, orhydrocephalus. 38,94,95Hamed et al have argued that primary superior oblique overaction and lateral alternating skew deviation are phenomenologicallyindistinguishable. 94,95Brodsky and Donahue pro- posed that both disorders represent a centralvestibular pitch imbalance. 38,67,224Instead of the"
Brodsky. 2006,"subjective tilt that leads to skew deviation withcomitant hypertropia, a subjective backward pitchwould be necessary to drive the eyes downward and produce the motility dysfunction seem with primary superior oblique muscle overaction and laterallyalternating skew deviation. Indeed, many childrenwith A-pattern esotropia and bilateral superioroblique overaction have tonic downgaze duringinfancy. 38A bilateral neurologic lesion that selec- tively inhibits those otolithic pathways correspond-ing to the anterior semicircular canals would lead to a predominance of output from otolithic pathwayscorresponding to the posterior semicircular ca-nals. 25As noted above, a posterior canal imbalance would cause the abducting eye to display a hyper-tropia on gaze to either side since the verticalactions of the activated superior oblique muscles aregreater in adduction ( Fig. 8 ). 38 Humans display an inherent upward tonus pre- dominance of the eyes which correlates withanatomical differences in the orientation of thesemicircular canals. 16Using a Maddox rod, Slavin et al found a bilateral physiologic hyperdeviationcorresponding to inferior oblique muscle over-action, (i.e., right hyperdeviation in gaze up andto the left, and left hyperdeviation in gaze up and to the right) in 22 of 61 normal subjects. 178Liesch and Simonsz127and Neikter147have performed pro- longed patching of one eye in normal subjects andelicited either unilateral (same eye) or bilateralinferior oblique muscle overaction. Brodsky andDonahue 38have proposed that early binocular visual loss could alter input to the cerebellarﬂocculus and thereby disinhibit otolithic pathways corresponding to the anterior canals. The vertical actions of the elevators (which are activated byanterior canal pathways) would then summate inadduction (where both the superior rectus andinferior oblique muscles have a primarily verticalaction). The ﬁnding of a normal anterior canalpredominance in humans could explain the smallphysiologic inferior oblique muscle overaction de- scribed by Slavin, and its clinical manifestation following unilateral patching. Physiologic inferioroblique muscle overaction may also contribute tophysiologic hyperphoria. 221 C."
Brodsky. 2006,"ACQUIRED COMITANT ESOTROPIA Acquired comitant esotropia is a perplexing disorder that is also produced by structural lesions within the posterior fossa. Because these lesions affect neurologic pathways subserving horizontalrather than vertical vergence mechanisms, they beara pathophysiologic resemblance to skew deviation.Acquired comitant esotropia can be produced bystructural lesions localized to the posterior fossasuch as cerebellar vermal tumors or Arnold Chiarimalformations. 106,107,125,218Some patients may also have divergence insufﬁciency.44,125Because these prenuclear lesions presumably disrupt central ves-tibular pathways subserving horizontal rather thanvertical vergence, the resulting esodeviation can beby conceptualized as a horizontal skew deviation,recognizing its mechanistic overlap with other formsof skew deviation. 34SKEW DEVIATION REVISITED 121 The physiologic underpinnings of horizontal skew deviation may lie in the translational vestibulo-ocular reﬂex. During fore-and-aft translation, vestib-ularly driven eye movements use radial optic ﬂowand binocular disparity vergence to minimize headmovement induced modulation of the ﬁxationplane. 135Visual tracking mechanisms that address translational disturbances are most accurately tuned for headings in the fore-aft axis (i.e., the surge plane) ( Table 3 ).6Disconjugate vergence move- ments during fore-and-aft translations exhibit muchhigher gains (at or above unity) than conjugateversion movements during lateral translation in thelateral plane (approximately 0.5), suggesting thatthe translational vestibulo-ocular reﬂex is tuned tostabilize binocular gaze in the same depth plane during translational movements. 6 While prenuclear lesions that disrupt vertical vergence generally localize to the brainstem, thosethat disrupt horizontal vergence tend to localize tothe cerebellum. 207Although little is known about the neurologic substrate of the translational vestibulo-ocular reﬂex, monkeys with lesions involving thedorsal cerebellar vermis develop an esotropia that is greater at distance than at near ﬁxation. 194,195Similar"
Brodsky. 2006,"observations are made clinically in adults withcerebellar disease who develop a divergence in-sufﬁciency-type esotropia. The dorsal vermis projectsto the fastigial oculomotor region, which has beenimplicated in the control of vergence. 195Neurons have been identiﬁed within the cerebellar vermis thatmodulate with convergence alone (Zhang HY, Gamlin PDR: Single-unit activity within the posterior fastigial nucleus during vergence and accommoda-tion in the alert primate. Soc Neurosci Abstr 1996:22)Humans with global cerebellar dysfunction can havean esophoria during monocular viewing and a smalleresotropia during binocular viewing, suggesting anincrease in esotonus to the extraocular muscles witha relatively preserved ability to use horizontal disparity cues to drive motor fusion. 194Further study will be necessary to determine whether patients withacquired comitant esotropia or divergence insufﬁ-ciency experience an altered internal representationof proximity ( Table 3 ). 34XIII. Prognosis and Treatment Because most ocular tilt reactions are transient and spontaneous recovery is the rule,18,123surgical therapy should be deferred for several months.During this period, prismatic treatment or botulinumtherapy can provide adequate symptomatic relief ofvertical diplopia. Prisms, botulinum toxin, andvertical rectus muscle recession have all been toutedas effective treatments for vertical diplopia secondaryto persistent skew deviation. 40,123,146,160,174The reso- lution of the ocular tilt reaction after unilateral vestibular deafferentation may be an index ofvestibular compensation. 90 It is important to recognize that these treatments will not eliminate the head tilt component (which issecondary to a central tilt in the subjective visualvertical and not compensatory for the verticaldiplopia). As noted above, the patient is usually unaware of the head tilt and grateful to be relieved of vertical diplopia following successful treatment.Treatment of a persistent head tilt poses a paradox-ical therapeutic dilemma. Because the head tiltserves to realign the head to a tilted subjectivevertical, any effort to simultaneously treat the headtilt would require surgically augmenting the tor-sional deviation to rotate the eyes further in the"
Brodsky. 2006,"direction of the head tilt. This surgical cyclorotation of the eyes would serve to counter-rotate the visualworld in the opposite direction (i.e., back towardthe true earth vertical) and thereby eliminate theneed for a compensatory head tilt. This therapeuticprinciple also underlies the use of horizontal trans-position of the vertical rectus muscles or obliquemuscle surgery in children with idiopathic torticollis and head tilts associated with congenital nystagmus. In patients with ocular tilt reactions, this procedurecould be combined with vertical rectus musclerecessions to treat both components of the oculartilt reaction. XIV. Questions Our enormous progress in elucidating the patho- physiology of skew deviation raises a number of TABLE 3 The Three Dimensions of Skew Deviation Clinical Disorder Plane Laterality Pathways Skew deviation Roll plane Unilateral Brain stem graviceptive pathways modulating otolithic tone Lateral alternating skew deviation Pitch plane Bilateral Brain stem graviceptive pathways modulating otolithic tone Horizontal skew deviation Surge plane ? Midline Cerebellar pathways mediating translational VOR122 Surv Ophthalmol 51 (2) March--April 2006 BRODSKY ET AL new questions. Because skew deviation is often associated with conjugate ocular torsion, are somepatients with unilateral otolithic dysfunction usinga combination of horizontal and vertical conver-gence to fuse a hyperphoria? Perhaps patients withmanifest hypertropia represent the most severe endof the spectrum. Is the subjective visual tiltnecessarily the cause of the skew deviation, ocular torsion, and head tilt? Although these three ocular motor phenomena accompany subjective visual tiltin the context of an ocular tilt reaction, recovery ofall these ocular motor phenomena is not necessarilycoincident with normalization of the subjectivevisual vertical. It is therefore possible that neuro-logic disease causes the ocular tilt reaction and thesubjective visual tilt together, with the subjective sense of vertical the most easily disrupted and the last to return to normal. Why is there so littlephysiologic skew deviation? What are the antivestib-ular forces independent of fusion that minimizephysiologic skew deviation during physiologic headtilt? Do some idiopathic head tilts (without strabis-mus) result from a central or peripheral otolithicimbalance?"
Brodsky. 2006,"It is well to remember that, when we treat idiopathic head tilts by torsional rotating the eyes in the direction of the head tilt, we aresurgically inducing a contraversive subjective visualtilt to neutralize the head tilt. XV. Conclusions Skew deviation has evolved from a descriptive term to a precise physiological mechanism of injury. Skew deviation results from a unilateral lesion that unilaterally injures the otolithic pathways andthereby causes the brain to perceive the world astilted. The resulting vertical deviation is but one partof an ocular tilt reaction which rotates the eyes andhead toward the tilted visual world to restore verticalorientation. Skew deviation can be caused by a lesionto utricular pathways anywhere from the utricle to midbrain. Partial injury that involves only those pathways corresponding to the anterior or posteriorsemicircular canals produces incomitant skew de-viation, while lateral alternating skew deviationresults from symmetric bilateral lesions involvingthese same pathways. While unilateral skew de-viation corresponds to central graviceptive dysfunc-tion of otolithic pathways in the roll plane, lateral alternating skew deviation corresponds to a central graviceptive dysfunction of otolithic pathways in thepitch plane. A developmental imbalance in visualinput between the two eyes produces a constellationof ocular motility abnormalities that is strikinglysimilar to those produced by the two labyrinths,suggesting that our eyes retain their primitiveevolutionary function as balance organs. By expand- ing our clinical deﬁnition of skew deviation toinclude those central vestibular imbalances inducedby binocular imbalance, we can broaden ourphysiologic perspective of skew deviation. Several challenges face the ophthalmologist who is evaluating a vertical ocular deviation of neuro-logic origin. First, the clinician must look for associated signs and symptoms of skew deviation (tilt of the subjective visual vertical, head tilt,torsion). Second, the clinician must measure thehyperdeviation in different ﬁelds of gaze to not onlyidentify clinical subtypes of skew deviation, but torecognize incomitant forms of skew deviation thatare due to selective patterns of injury to the anterioror posterior semicircular canals, and to distinguish them from isolated superior or inferior oblique muscle palsy."
Brodsky. 2006,"Third, it should be remembered thatlesions producing skew deviation can also compro-mise ocular motor nerve function to producea complex clinical picture. Finally, developmentalaberrations in binocular alignment can produceequivalent ocular motility disturbances and must beconsidered in the differential diagnosis. XVI. Method of Literature Search References were obtained from English and non- English references for skew deviation, and ocular tiltreaction. English references from 1966 to 2005 wereobtained from MEDLINE, and older English andnon-English references were obtained from neuro-ophthalmology textbooks and major articles that addressed the topic of skew deviation. Due to the large number of experimental animal studies in-vestigating the ocular motor consequences ofbrainstem or cerebellar lesioning on vertical ocularalignment, only the seminal neurophysiologic stud-ies that related directly to the mechanism of skewdeviation and the ocular tilt reaction were cited.

They are often the initial manifestation of diseases affecting the central nervous system. Un-derstanding eye movement disorders remains challenging, partly because it requiresknowledge of the underlying anatomy and physiology ."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Although there are a numberof excellent texts covering this subject, few present the information in a clear andconcise manner with accompanying anatomic diagrams to elucidate the intricate re-lationships among clinical phenomena, basic neuroanatomy , and neurophysiology .With this book, I have attempted to ﬁll this gap: text and illustrations are combinedto provide a coherent and easy-to-assimilate description and explanation of differenteye movement disorders. The text is divided into four parts. The ﬁrst part consists of chapters for each of the eye movement subsystems. Readers will ﬁnd a description of thematic “concepts” onthe left-hand pages, with accompanying ﬁgures, a synopsis of the pertinent points,and important clinical points (highlighted in green) on the right-hand pages. My aimis to present the material that appears on the left-hand pages as succinct, accessibleinformation for easy review on the right-hand pages. Parts II through IV describe different eye movement disorders in detail. Bulleted and numbered lists have been used to reduce the overall volume of the text without com-promising the clarity of the information. Each chapter contains color-coded sectionsto allow ready review. The clinical features of different disorders are summarized inyellow boxes, etiology in green boxes, and differential diagnosis in orange boxes.Main eye movement abnormalities characteristic of different diseases are summa-rized in blue boxes, and the anatomic and physiological basis for the observed ab-normal eye movements are explained separately , as footnotes. Throughout the text,readers will also ﬁnd this icon 8, which indicates that a video clip of the correspon- ding eye movement disorder is available in the book’s accompanying CD-ROM. Inaddition, the book is amply illustrated with schematic diagrams of relevant anatomyand brain pathways. Tables have also been used liberally to provide a readily accessi-ble overview of information. The book is comprehensive, though not exhaustive; I have aimed at a clear and understandable presentation of what I think are the most important aspects of eyemovement disorders. I encourage readers to consult other excellent texts and thereferences provided for more detail on particular subjects of interest, particularlyLeigh and Zee, The Neurology of Eye Movements , Fourth Edition, and Miller et al., Walsh and Hoyt’s Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology , Sixth Edition.

The eyeball rotates about threeaxes: horizontal, vertical, and torsional. These axes intersect at the center of the eye-ball. Eye rotations are achieved by coordinated contraction and relaxation of six ex-traocular muscles—four rectus and two oblique—attached to each eye. The action ofthe muscles on the globe is determined by the point of rotation of the globe, as wellas the origin and insertion of each muscle. Recent evidence suggests that the musclesalso exert their effects on the globe via the extraocular muscle pulleys. Considering that we make at least 100,000 saccades alone each day , it is not surpris- ing that many extraocular muscles are very resistant to fatigue. Extraocular musclesare also different from other skeletal muscles in many respects. For example, eyemuscle ﬁbers are richly innervated, and each motoneuron innervates only 10–20muscle ﬁbers, the smallest motor unit known in the body ."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Extraocular muscles alsohave more mitochondria and a higher metabolic rate than other skeletal muscles.Thus, extraocular muscles are one of the fastest contracting muscles. This propertyallows animals to shift gaze swiftly , so that they can avoid approaching predators ordetect prey in the vicinity . The unique immunologic and physiologic properties ofextraocular muscles may also explain why they are more susceptible to certain dis-ease processes, such as Grave’s disease and chronic progressive external ophthalmo-plegia, but more resistant to others such as Duchenne’s dystrophy , which mainly affects skeletal muscles in the rest of the body . 1.1 Three Axes of Eye Rotations The eyeball rotates about three axes: x-axis (naso-occipital or roll axis), y-axis (earth- horizontal or pitch axis), and z-axis (earth-vertical or yaw axis). Ductions refer to monocular movements of each eye. They include abduction, adduction, elevation (sursumduction), depression (deorsumduction), incycloduc- tion or incyclotorsion, and excycloduction or excyclotorsion (see table on oppositepage). Versions refer to binocular conjugate movements of both eyes, such that the visual axes of the eyes move in the same direction. They include dextroversion, levover- sion, elevation (sursumversion), depression (deorsumversion), dextrocycloversion,and levocycloversion (see table). Vergences refer to binocular disjunctive movements, such that the visual axes of the eyes move in opposite directions. They include convergence, divergence, incyclover- gence, and excyclovergence (see table). Eye rotations are achieved by coordinated contraction of six extraocular muscles in each eye: the medial rectus, lateral rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, superioroblique, and inferior oblique. The action of the muscles on the globe is determinedby the point of rotation of the globe, as well as by the origin and insertion of eachmuscle. The tendons of the rectus muscles pass through sleevelike pulleys locatedseveral millimeters posterior to the equator of the globe and approximately 10 mmposterior to the insertion sites of the muscles."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"These pulleys, consisting of ﬁbroustissue and smooth muscle, limit side-slip movement of the rectus muscles during eyerotations and act as the functional origins of the rectus muscles. 4 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Three Axes of Eye Rotations Chapter 1 Eye Rotations, the Extraocular Muscles, and Strabismus Terminology 5z-axis (abduction and adduction) y-axis (elevation and depression)  x-axis (incyclotorsion and excyclotorsion) Term Deﬁnition Ductions Ductions refer to monocular movements of each eye ■Abduction occurs about the z-axis and is away from the median plane ■Adduction occurs about the z-axis and is toward the median plane ■Elevation occurs about the y-axis and is an upward rotation of the eye ■Depression occurs about the y-axis and is a downward rotation of the eye ■Incycloduction (incyclotorsion) occurs about the x-axis so that the upper pole of the eye rotates toward the median plane ■Excycloduction (excyclotorsion) occurs about the x-axis so that the upper pole of the eye rotates away from the median plane Versions Versions refer to binocular conjugate movements of both eyes, such that the visual axes of the eyes move in the same direction ■Dextroversion : both eyes rotating about their z-axes to the right ■Levoversion : both eyes rotating about their z-axes to the left ■Elevation: both eyes rotating about their y-axes to look upward ■Depression : both eyes rotating about their y-axes to look downward ■Dextrocycloversion : both eyes rotating about their x-axes so that the upper pole of both eyes rotates to the subject’s right ■Levocycloversion : both eyes rotating about their x-axes so that the upper pole of both eyes rotates to the subject’s left Vergences Vergences refer to binocular disjunctive movements, such that the visual axes of the eyes move in opposite directions ■Convergence : both eyes rotating about their z-axes toward the median plane ■Divergence : both eyes rotating about their z-axes away from the median plane"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"■Incyclovergence : rotation of both eyes about their x-axes so that the upper pole of both eyes rotates toward the median plane ■Excyclovergence: rotation of both eyes about their x-axes so that the upper pole of both eyes rotates away from the median plane 1.2 Actions of the Extraocular Muscles The primary position of the eye is deﬁned clinically as the position in which the eye is directed straight ahead with the body and head erect. The primary action of amuscle is its major rotational effect on the eye while the eye is in primary position.The secondary and tertiary actions of a muscle are additional rotational effects onthe eye while it is in primary position. The four rectus muscles arise from the annulus of Zinn at the apex of the orbit. The medial rectus inserts onto the medial side of the globe at approximately 5.3 ( ±0.7) mm from the corneoscleral limbus, whereas the lateral rectus inserts onto the lat- eral side of the globe at approximately 6.9 ( ±0.7) mm from the limbus. Because the origins and insertions of the horizontal rectus muscles are symmetric and lie in thehorizontal meridian of the globe, their functions are relatively simple and are antag-onistic; contraction of the medial rectus adducts the globe, whereas contraction ofthe lateral rectus abducts the globe. The superior and inferior recti also originate from the annulus of Zinn. The superior rectus inserts onto the globe superiorly at approximately 7.9 ( ±0.6) mm from the limbus, and the inferior rectus inserts inferiorly at approximately 6.8 ( ±0.8) mm from the limbus. In addition, their insertions onto the globe subtend a 23° angle with the visual axis when the eye is in primary position, straddling the vertical meridian ofthe globe. Thus, in addition to its primary action of elevation, the superior rectus hasa secondary action of incyclotorsion and a tertiary action of adduction. The primaryaction of the inferior rectus is depression, its secondary action is excyclotorsion, andits tertiary action is adduction. The relative importance of the primary and secondaryactions depends on the direction of the visual axis."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"When the eye is abducted 23°, thesuperior rectus acts solely as an elevator, and the inferior rectus acts solely as a de-pressor. When the eye is adducted 67°, the superior rectus acts solely to incyclotortthe globe, and the inferior rectus acts solely to excyclotort the globe. The superior oblique also arises from the annulus of Zinn; however, its functional origin is the trochlea in the superomedial orbit. The superior oblique is tendinous af- ter it passes through the trochlea. This tendon then assumes a posterolateral direc-tion and inserts onto the superior posterotemporal quadrant of the globe behind thecenter of rotation. This vector plane subtends a 54° angle with the visual axis whenthe eye is in primary position. Thus, in addition to its primary action of incyclotor-sion, the superior oblique also has a secondary action of depression and tertiary ac-tion of abduction. When the eye is adducted 54°, the superior oblique acts solely to depress the globe, and when the eye is abducted 36°, it acts solely to incyclotort the globe. The inferior oblique arises from the anterior medial orbital ﬂoor, and thus it is the only extraocular muscle that does not arise from the annulus of Zinn. It inserts onto the inferior posterotemporal quadrant of the globe behind the center of rotation and subtends a 51° angle with the visual axis when the eye is in primary position. Thus,in addition to its primary action of excyclotorsion, the inferior oblique has a sec-ondary action of elevation and a tertiary action of abduction. When the eye is ad-ducted 51°, the inferior oblique acts solely to elevate the globe, and when the eye isabducted 39°, it acts solely to excyclotort the globe. 6 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Actions of Extracoular Muscles Chapter 1 Eye Rotations, the Extraocular Muscles, and Strabismus Terminology 7Superior rectus  (Top view) Combined elevation & incyclotorsion when the eye is in primary positionElevation when the eye is in Incyclotorsion when the eye is"

Sherrington’s law of reciprocal innervation states that, whenever an agonist muscle (e.g., the medial rectus of the right eye during adduction) receives an excitatory signal to contract, an equivalentinhibitory signal is sent to the antagonist muscle (e.g., the right lateral rectus) of thesame eye. This reciprocal innervation is mainly due to central connections in thebrainstem. A yoked muscle pair consists of one muscle from each eye and moves both eyes to- ward the same direction. For example, the right lateral rectus and the left medial rec-tus contract simultaneously when looking to the right. Hering’s law of equal in-"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"nervation (or law of motor correspondence) states that, during conjugate eye movements, the yoked muscle pair receives equal innervation so that the eyes movetogether. Vertically acting muscles are also conceptualized as being arranged asyoked pairs (e.g., the right superior rectus and left inferior oblique form a pair, andthe right inferior rectus and the left superior oblique form another pair). However,the way in which extraocular muscles interact is very complex, and all muscles prob-ably contribute, even during a simple horizontal movement. During clinical examination, the primary position refers to the position when the eyes look straight ahead. Secondary positions are right gaze, left gaze, straight up, and straight down. Tertiary positions are up and right, down and right, up and left,and down and left. The six cardinal positions include right gaze, left gaze, and the four tertiary posi- tions. These eye positions provide the most information about the horizontal func- tion of the horizontal rectus muscles (lateral and medial rectus) and the verticalfunction of the cyclovertical muscles (superior rectus, inferior rectus, superioroblique, and inferior oblique). For example, on right and up gaze, the prime eleva-tors are the superior rectus in the right eye and the inferior oblique in the left eye. Inthis gaze position, the right superior rectus is the prime elevator when the right eyeis abducted (by the action of the lateral rectus) because it inserts at a 23° angle to thevisual axis. Similarly , the left inferior oblique is the prime elevator when the left eyeis adducted (by the action of the medial rectus) because it inserts at a 51° angle tothe visual axis. It is important to emphasize that the cardinal positions of gaze do not correspond to the primary , secondary , or tertiary actions of the muscles. For example, when theright eye looks right and up, the right superior rectus is not responsible for bothele- vation andabduction; in fact, the tertiary action of the superior rectus is adduction, not abduction. In other words, when the right eye looks right and up, elevationcomes mainly from contraction of the superior rectus, whereas abduction comesmainly from contraction of the lateral rectus."

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"4 Structure and Function of Extraocular Muscle Fibers The rectus and oblique muscles consist of two distinct layers: an outer orbital layer adjacent to the periorbita and orbital bone, and an inner global layer adjacent to the eye and the optic nerve. Whereas the global layer extends the full muscle length, in- serting via a well-deﬁned tendon, the orbital layer ends before the muscle becomestendinous. Each layer contains ﬁbers more suited for sustained contraction or for brief,rapid contraction. Six types of ﬁbers have been identiﬁed in the extraocular muscles. In the orbital layer, about 80% of the ﬁbers are singly innervated ﬁbers (SIF). Not only do these ﬁbers exhibit the fast type of myoﬁbrillar ATPase and high oxidative ac- tivity , but they also appear to be capable of anaerobic activity . They have twitch ca-pacity and are the most fatigue-resistant ﬁbers. They are the only ﬁber type that showslong-term effects after injection of botulinum toxin. The remaining 20% of orbitalﬁbers are multiply innervated ﬁbers (MIF). They have twitch capacity near the cen- ter of the ﬁber and non-twitch activity proximal and distal to the endplate band. In the global layer, about 33% of ﬁbers are red SIFs , which are fast twitch and highly fatigue resistant. Another 32% are white (pale) SIFs with fast-twitch proper- ties but low fatigue resistance. Intermediate SIFs constitute about another 25% of ﬁbers. They have fast-twitch properties and an intermediate level of fatigue resis- tance. The remaining 10% are MIFs , with synaptic endplate along their entire length, as well as at the myotendinous junction, where there are palisade organ pro-prioceptors. These ﬁbers show tonic properties, with slow, graded, nonpropagatedresponses to neural or pharmacological activation. The levator palpebrae muscle contains the three singly innervated muscle types found in the global layer of the extraocular muscles and a true slow-twitch ﬁber type."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The MIF type and the fatigue-resistant SIF type seen in the orbital layer of theextraocular muscles are absent in the levator. The functional arrangement of muscle ﬁber types is related to the threshold at which motor units are recruited. During saccades and quick phases of nystagmus, all ﬁbertypes are recruited synchronously . In contrast, during slow eye movements and ﬁxa-tion (gaze holding), there is a differential recruitment of ﬁber types that is dependenton eye position. Orbital SIFs and global red SIFs are recruited ﬁrst, when eye posi-tion is still in the direction opposite to the muscle action. Multiply innervated ﬁbertypes are recruited next, probably near straight-ahead position, where their ﬁne in-crements of force would be of value for ﬁxation. The increasingly faster but fatigableﬁbers are recruited last, at eye position well into the direction of muscle action. The palisade tendon organs are the primary proprioceptors in human extraocular muscles. They are found in the distal myotendinous junctions of global MIFs. Affer- ents from these proprioceptors project, via the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminalnerve and the Gasserian ganglion, to the spinal trigeminal nucleus. They may alsoproject centrally via the ocular motor nerves. From the trigeminal nucleus, proprio-ceptive information is sent to structures involved in ocular motor control, including the superior colliculus, vestibular nuclei, nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, cerebellum, and frontal eye ﬁelds. Proprioceptive information is also sent to structures involved invisual processing, including the lateral geniculate body , pulvinar, and visual cortex. 10 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Structure and Function of Extraocular Muscle Fibers Chapter 1 Eye Rotations, the Extraocular Muscles, and Strabismus Terminology 11The palisade tendon organs ■Primary proprioceptors in human extraocular muscles ■Found in the distal myotendinous junctions of global multiply innervated ﬁbers ■Project to the spinal trigeminal nucleus via the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and the Gasserian ganglion, or via the ocular motor nerves"

(Modiﬁed from Porter et al. Extraocular muscles: Basic and clinical aspects of structure and function. Surv Ophthelmol. 1995; 39: 451–84.) 1.5 Strabismus Terminology The line connecting the object of ﬁxation to the fovea is the visual axis . Strabismus is deﬁned as a misalignment of the visual axes between the two eyes. Orthophoria is the ideal condition of eye alignment. In reality , it is seldom encoun- tered because the majority of people have a latent misalignment. By deﬁnition, or- thophoria indicates that the oculomotor apparatus is in perfect equilibrium so thatboth eyes remain aligned in all positions of gaze and at all distances of ﬁxation dur-ing viewing with one eye (monocular viewing). Orthotropia refers to perfect align- ment of the eyes during viewing with both eyes (binocular viewing). Heterodeviation refers to ocular alignment that differs from orthophoria. It includes both heterophoria and heterotropia . Heterophoria is a latent deviation controlled by"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"binocular ﬁxation, such that, during viewing with both eyes, the eyes remain aligned.In contrast, heterotropia is a deviation present during viewing with both eyes (i.e.,manifest deviation). There are a variety of heterophoric and heterotropic deviations. If the visual axes con- verge, the condition is called esophoria (for latent deviation) or esotropia (for mani- fest deviation). If the visual axes diverge, the condition is known as exophoria or ex- otropia . Uncrossed diplopia is double vision caused by esotropia. The false image is displaced on the same side as the deviated eye. Crossed diplopia is double vision caused by exotropia. The false image is displaced to the side opposite the deviated eye. Hyperphoria (for latent deviation) or hypertropia (for manifest deviation) occurs if the visual axis of the nonﬁxating eye is higher than that of the ﬁxating eye. For ex- ample, a right hyperphoria or hypertropia is a deviation in which the visual axis ofthe nonﬁxating right eye is higher than that of the left. Cyclodeviation is a torsional misalignment of the eyes, causing a cyclodisparity . Incyclodeviation refers to a rela- tive incyclotorsion of the eyes (decreased separation of upper poles of eyes),whereas excyclodeviation refers to a relative excyclotorsion of the eyes (increased separation of upper poles of eyes). Strabismus may be comitant or incomitant. In concomitant or comitant strabismus, the magnitude of deviation is the same in all directions of gaze and does not depend on the eye used for ﬁxation. In incomitant or noncomitant strabismus, the deviation varies in different directions of gaze. Most incomitant strabismus is caused by a para-lytic or a mechanical restrictive process. The deviation is largest when the eyes turn inthe direction of the paralytic or underacting muscle. The deviation in incomitant stra-bismus also varies with the eye used for ﬁxation."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"When the normal eye is ﬁxating, theamount of misalignment is called primary deviation. When the paretic eye is ﬁxat- ing, the amount of misalignment is called secondary deviation. Secondary deviation is larger than primary deviation in incomitant strabismus because an increase in in-nervation is needed for a paretic eye to ﬁxate a target. By Hering’s law, the contralateralyoked muscle also receives more innervation, resulting in a larger deviation. Weakness of a muscle can be classiﬁed as a paralysis or paresis. If the action of a mus- cle is completely abolished, the condition is a paralysis or palsy; if the action of a mus-cle is weakened but not abolished, it is called a paresis. The terms palsy and paresis areoften used interchangeably in clinical settings and in neurologic practice. In this book,the term palsy is used to denote a partial or a complete impairment of muscle action. 12 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 1 Eye Rotations, the Extraocular Muscles, and Strabismus Terminology 13Strabismus Terminology Term Deﬁnition Visual axis The line connecting the object of ﬁxation to the fovea Strabismus A misalignment or deviation of the visual axes Orthophoria Alignment of the visual axes while viewing with one eye Orthotropia Alignment of the visual axes while viewing with both eyes Heterophoria A latent misalignment of the visual axes while viewing with one eye Heterotropia A manifest misalignment of the visual axes while viewing with both eyes Esophoria/esotropia Convergence of visual axes (i.e., crossed eyes) during viewing with one eye (esophoria) or during viewing with both eyes (esotropia) Exophoria/exotropia Divergence of visual axes (i.e., walled eyes) during viewing with one eye (exophoria) or during viewing with both eyes (exotropia) Hyperphoria/hypertropia Vertical misalignment of the visual axes with the nonﬁxating eye higher than the ﬁxating eye during viewing with one eye (hyperphoria) or during viewing with both eyes (hypertropia)"

A large ﬁeld of vision allows an animal to survey the environment for foodand to avoid predators, thus increasing its survival rate. Similarly , a high visual acu-ity also increases survival rates by allowing an animal to aim at a target more accu-rately , leading to higher killing rates and more food. However, there are simply notenough neurons in the brain to support a visual system that has high resolution overthe entire ﬁeld of vision."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Faced with the competing evolutionary demands for highvisual acuity and a large ﬁeld of vision, an effective strategy is needed so that thebrain will not be overwhelmed by a large amount of visual input. Some animals,such as rabbits, give up high resolution in favor of a larger ﬁeld of vision (rabbits cansee nearly 360°), whereas others, such as hawks, restrict their ﬁeld of vision in returnfor a high visual acuity (hawks have vision as good as 20/2, about 10 times betterthan humans). In humans, rather than using one strategy over the other, the retinadevelops a very high spatial resolution in the center (i.e., the fovea), and a muchlower resolution in the periphery . Although this “foveal compromise” strategy solvesthe problem of information overload, one result is that unless the image of an objectof interest happens to fall on the fovea, the image is relegated to the low-resolutionretinal periphery . The evolution of a mechanism to move the eyes is therefore necessary to comple- ment this foveal compromise strategy by ensuring that an object of interest is main-tained or brought to the fovea. To maintain the image of an object on the fovea, thevestibulo-ocular (VOR) and optokinetic systems generate eye movements to com- pensate for head motions. Likewise, the saccadic, smooth pursuit, and vergence sys- tems generate eye movements to bring the image of an object of interest on thefovea. These different eye movements have different characteristics and involve dif-ferent parts of the brain. In this chapter, the ﬁxation system is discussed; the VORand optokinetic systems, saccades, smooth pursuit, and vergence systems are dis-cussed in subsequent chapters. 2.1 Introduction to the Six Eye Movement Systems The six eye movement systems can be functionally divided into those that hold im- ages of a target steady on the retina and those that direct the fovea onto an object ofinterest. The former category includes (1) the ﬁxation system, which holds the im- age of a stationary object on the fovea when the head is immobile; (2) the vestibular"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"system (or the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex), which holds the image of a target steady onthe retina during brief head movements; and (3) the optokinetic system, which holds the image of a target steady on the retina during sustained head movements. The latter category , systems that direct the fovea onto an object of interest, includes (1) the saccadic system, which brings the image of an object of interest rapidly onto the fovea; (2) the smooth pursuit system, which holds the image of a small, moving target on the fovea; and (3) the vergence system, which moves the eyes in an oppo- site direction (i.e., convergence or divergence) so that images of a single object areheld simultaneously on both foveae. Clinically , to localize a lesion, it is important to assess whether one or more eye movement systems are affected. For example, a discrete lesion in the paramedianpontine reticular formation affects ipsilesional horizontal saccades only , whereas alesion in the abducens nucleus affects all ipsilesional horizontal eye movements, in-cluding saccades, smooth pursuit, and the VOR (see sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2). 16 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Functional Classiﬁcation of the Six Eye Movement Systems Hold images steady on the retina Fixation: holds the image of a stationary object on the fovea when the head is im- mobile Vestibular (VOR): holds image steady on the retina during brief head movements Optokinetic: holds image steady on the retina during sustained head movements Direct the fovea to an object of interest Saccades: bring the image of an object of interest rapidly onto the fovea Smooth pursuit: holds the image of a small moving target on the fovea Vergence: moves the eyes in an opposite direction (i.e., convergence or divergence) so that images of a single object are held simultaneously on both foveae Chapter 2 Introduction to the Six Eye Movement Systems and the Visual Fixation System 17Clinical Point To localize a lesion, it is important to assess whether one or more eye movement systems are affected.

Steady ﬁxation is actually an illusion. Normal ﬁxation consists ofthree distinct types of physiological miniature movements that are not detectable bythe naked eye: microsaccades, microdrift, and microtremor. Microsaccades are miniature saccades that have an amplitude of less than 26 min of arc, with an average amplitude of 6 min of arc. They occur at a mean frequency of approximately 120 Hz. Microsaccades have no known function and are consideredsuperﬂuous to visual perception. Microdrift consists of smooth eye movements that occur at a velocity of less than 20 min of arc per second. They are necessary to prevent the image of a stable object from fading. Microtremor is continuous, high-frequency ocular motor activity that underlies both microdrift and microsaccades. Microtremor occurs at a frequency of 50–100 Hz. Its average amplitude is < 1 min of arc (usually 5–30 sec of arc) and is much smaller than the amplitude of microsaccades. Visual ﬁxation is an active process, not merely an absence of visible eye movements. Several cerebral areas participate in visual ﬁxation. They include the parietal eyeﬁeld (lateral interparietal area [LIP] and area 7a in monkeys), V5 and V5A (middletemporal [MT] and medial superior temporal [MST] areas in monkeys), supplemen-tary eye ﬁeld, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Brainstem structures, includingsubstantia nigra pars reticulata in the basal ganglia and the rostral pole of the supe-rior colliculus, are also involved in ﬁxation. Involuntary disruption of normal ﬁxation may cause oscillopsia , an illusion of"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"movement of the stationary environment. Oscillopsia can be caused by ocular oscil- lations, which include (1) nystagmus, sustained oscillation initiated by slow eye movements; (2) saccadic intrusion, intermittent oscillation initiated by fasteye move- ments; and (3) saccadic oscillation, sustained oscillation initiated by fasteye move- ments. Oscillopsia can also occur in patients with peripheral or central vestibulardysfunction, as well as in patients with central lesion, such as seizure or occipitallobe infarct. Nystagmus and saccadic dyskinesia are discussed further in part II. 18 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems The Visual Fixation System Chapter 2 Introduction to the Six Eye Movement Systems and the Visual Fixation System 19Normal Fixation 1.

The vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (VOR) stabilizes retinal images during head motion by counter-rotating the eyes at the same speed as the head butin the opposite direction. Information about head motion passes from the vestibularsensors in the inner ear to the VOR circuitry within the brainstem, which computesan appropriate eye velocity command."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The eyes, conﬁned in their bony orbits, nor-mally do not change position, and their motion relative to the head is restricted to achange in orientation. However, the head can both change position and orientationrelative to space. Thus, the function of the VOR is to generate eye orientation thatbest compensates for changes in position and orientation of the head. Because thedrive for this reﬂex is vestibular rather than visual, it operates even in darkness. To appreciate the beneﬁts of having our eyes under vestibular and not just visual con- trol, hold a page of text in front of you, and oscillate it back and forth horizontally ata rate of about two cycles per second. You will ﬁnd that the text is blurred. However,if you hold the page still and instead oscillate your head at the same rate, you will beable to read the text clearly . This is because when the page moves, only visual infor-mation is available. Visual information normally takes about 100 msec to travel fromthe visual cortices, through a series of brain structures, to the ocular motoneuronsthat move the eyes. This delay is simply too long for the eyes to keep up with the os-cillating page. However, when the head moves, both vestibular and visual informationare available. Vestibular information takes only about 7–15 msec to travel from thevestibular sensors, through the brainstem, to the ocular motoneurons. With this shortlatency , the eyes can easily compensate for the rapid oscillation of the head. Thus,damages to the vestibular system often cause oscillopsia, an illusion of motion in thestationary environment, especially during head movements. Indeed, as described by aphysician who lost his vestibular function from streptomycin ototoxicity; without aVOR, every movement, including his own carotid pulse, jarred his vision ( LIVING without a balancing mechanism , New England Journal of Medicine, 1952). Optokinetic eye movements stabilize the eyes during tracking of a large moving visual scene, which causes an illusionary sensation of self-rotation (circularvection)in the opposite direction."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Optokinetic eye movements must be distinguished fromsmooth pursuit movements (discussed in chapter 5), which are used to keep theimage of a small moving target on the fovea. If you sit inside a rotating drumpainted on the inside with stripes or spots such that the entire visual ﬁeld is per-ceived as rotating en bloc, your eyes will track the ﬁeld rotation with a nystagmuspattern of slow phases in the direction of drum rotation and quick phases in theopposite direction. This response is called optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), and theneural system responsible for it is the optokinetic reﬂex (OKR). In nature, almostthe only situation in which a large visual scene moves en bloc is when the animal it-self is moving and its VOR is not compensating perfectly . Therefore, it is believedthat the OKR serves as a visual backup for the VOR to generate compensatory eyemovements. That the brain normally interprets en bloc motion of the visual ﬁeld asevidence for self-motion is shown by the compelling motion illusions we experi-ence while watching IMAX movies, or when the train beside the one you are on be-gins to move out of the station. Clinically , damage to the vestibular sensors on one side, say , the left side, upsets the balance between vestibular signals generated from both sides. This leads to an illusory 22 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems sensation of self-rotation (vertigo) to the right. In addition, because the brain mistak- enly believes that the head is rotating to the right, it rotates the eyes slowly to the left tocompensate. As the eyes reach their leftward orbital limits, they quickly snap backrightward toward the straight-ahead positions and then resume their leftward drift.This repetitive combination of slow phases that alternate with corrective quick phasesis called nystagmus . Usually , the nystagmus and vertigo only last for a few days. This is because the abnormal vestibular sensation contradicts information from all othersenses, including vision, sense of limb position, and sense of touch. Thus, with time,the brain makes an unconscious self-diagnosis by localizing the lesion to the leftvestibular sensors and adapts by reestablishing the balance between the right and leftinner ears."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"These adaptive and repair functions are performed by the cerebellum. In this chapter, the characteristics of the VOR, as well as the anatomy , physiology , and functional organization of the vestibular sensors (the semicircular canals and theotoliths) are described. The role of the cerebellum in VOR adaptation and the con-cept of velocity storage, which explains disorders such as periodic alternating nys-tagmus, are discussed next. The optokinetic system, which serves as a visual backupfor the VOR, is then discussed. Finally , some tests of vestibular functions that couldbe performed at bedside are described. Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 23 3.1 The Vestibulo-Ocular Reﬂex The VOR stabilizes retinal images during brief head movements by counter-rotating the eyes at the same speed as the head but in the opposite direction. There are twotypes of head motion: rotation and translation . A change in orientation is called ro- tation, whereas a change in position is called translation. Motion of the head is detected by the peripheral vestibular apparatus, or labyrinth, which is composed of two parts: (1) the three semicircular canals and (2) the otolith organs, which consist of the utricle and the saccule. The three semicircular canals are oriented perpendicular to one another. Thisarrangement allows them to detect rotation (angular acceleration) of the head inthree directions: horizontal (yaw, about the earth-vertical axis), vertical (pitch, aboutthe earth-horizontal or interaural axis), and torsional (roll, about the naso-occipitalaxis). The otolith organs, in contrast, detect translation (linear acceleration) of thehead in three directions: horizontal (heave, or side to side, along the interaural axis),vertical (bob, or up and down, along the dorsal–ventral axis) and fore and aft (surge,along the naso-occipital axis). The otolith organs also detect static head tilt (i.e., theposition of the head with respect to gravity). 24 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems The Vestibulo-Ocular Reﬂex Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 25 Semicircular canals Ampullae"

Vestibulo-ocular reﬂex gain varies with frequency of head motion, and itmust approximate −1.0 to prevent retinal images from slipping. At frequencies that correspond to most natural head rotations (0.5–5 Hz), horizontal and vertical VORgains approximate −0.9 in dark. In light, the gains are close to −1.0 due to visual en- hancement, which is mediated by the optokinetic, smooth pursuit, or the ﬁxationsystems. If the gain is too much above or below its ideal value of unity , a target im-age remains off the fovea, although it may be transiently stable on the retina. Themotion of the eyes and head must also be 180° out of phase. This normal phase dif- ference is designated zero, by convention. If there is a phase lead of the eyes beforethe head or a phase lag behind it, the target image is never stationary on the retina.An abnormal gain or phase of the VOR causes visual blur and oscillopsia . During dynamic head roll (i.e., tilting of the head alternately between the right andleft shoulder), compensatory eye movements are generated by torsional VOR, whichis mediated predominantly by the vertical semicircular canals (i.e., the anterior andposterior canals)."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The dynamic torsional VOR has a lower gain than horizontal orvertical VOR, typically ranging from −0.4 to −0.7, depending on the frequency of head roll. In contrast, static head roll evokes compensatory changes in torsional eyeposition, which are mediated by the otolith–ocular reﬂex from inputs of the utricles.Static torsional VOR (also known as ocular counter-roll) has a lower gain than its dynamic counterpart, ranging from −0.1 to −0.24, depending on target distance and target features. Peripheral and central vestibular lesions cause static and dynamic imbalance of the VOR. Static imbalance of canal inputs or connections leads to spontaneous nystag-mus, whereas dynamic imbalance affects the gain and phase of the VOR. 26 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Characteristics of the VOR Function: The VOR stabilizes retinal image during brief head movement by generat- ing eye movements that are equal in amplitude and opposite in direction to head movements Quantiﬁed by: VOR gain and phase Gain =Eye velocity/Head velocity =−1.0 (ideally) Phase =Temporal difference between head and eye movements =180° out of phase (i.e., zero phase shift) (ideally) Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 27Velocity (deg/s)Right LeftPeak head velocity Peak eye velocityHead Eye Normal values 1.

One end of each semicircular canal dilates to form the ampulla , the epithelium of which thickens in a region called the ampullary crest . The ampullary crest contains vestibular hair cells, which are innervated by bipolar sensory neurons of the vestibular nerve. The ampullary crest is covered by a gelatinous, diaphragmlike mass called the cupula. When the head changes its velocity of rotation (i.e., undergoes a net angular accel- eration), endolymph is free to continue in its prior state of motion or lack of it (i.e.,inertia ), such that the endolymph ﬂows relative to the canal wall, which is embed- ded in the skull. Whenever net endolymph motion is registered, the force exerted bythe inertia of the endolymph distends the cupula in the opposite direction to thehead rotation. This in turn displaces the cilia on the hair cells, elicits a receptor po-tential, and activates the vestibular nerve. Once the head attains a stable angular ve-locity (i.e., zero acceleration), the endolymph catches up through frictional forces toreach the same velocity as the head, so that no net movement occurs between the en-dolymph and the wall of the canal, causing the receptor potential to cease. Hence,net endolymph motion with respect to the canal wall is a function of angular accel-eration, and the semicircular canals detect angular acceleration of the head. The internal diameter of the semicircular canals is small relative to their radius of cur- vature. This geometry , together with the hydrodynamic properties of the endolymph,dictates that the motion of endolymph and the change in position of the cupula beproportional to head velocity ."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"In other words, the semicircular canals mechanically in-tegrate, in the mathematical sense, the angular head acceleration that they detect toyield a head velocity signal that is then encoded by the vestibular nerve. A portion of the ﬂoor of the utricle and the medial wall of the saccule is also thick- ened to form the macula , which contains hair cells innervated by bipolar sensory neurons of the vestibular nerve. In contrast to the ampulla of the canals, the maculaof the utricle and saccule is covered with a gelatinous substance that contains crystalsof calcium carbonate called otoconia. The macula of the utricle lies approximately in the horizontal plane, whereas the macula of the saccule lies approximately in the ver-tical plane. When the head is tilted or undergoes linear acceleration, the otoliths de-form the gelatinous mass, which in turn bends the protruding cilia on the hair cells,resulting in a receptor potential and altering the activity level of the vestibular nerve. The cell bodies of the bipolar sensory neurons lie in the vestibular ganglion ( Scarpa’s ganglion ) near the internal auditory meatus. The peripheral axons of bipolar sen- sory neurons form the vestibular nerve and enter the vestibular ganglion via two di- visions: superior and inferior. The superior division of the vestibular nerve inner-vates the macula of the utricle, the anterior part of the macula of the saccule, andthe ampullae of the horizontal and anterior semicircular canals. The inferior divisioninnervates the posterior part of the macula of the saccule and the ampulla of theposterior canal. The vestibular nerve then joins the cochlear nerve to form thevestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve), which runs through the internalauditory meatus along with the facial nerve. The vestibulocochlear nerve then trav-erses the cerebellopontine angle to enter the brainstem between the inferior cerebel-lar peduncle and the spinal trigeminal tract to synapse in the vestibular nucleus. 28 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 29Anatomy of the Semicircular Canals and the Otoliths"

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"This geometry , to-gether with the hydrodynamic properties of the en-dolymph, causes the motion of endolymph and thechange in position of the cupula to be proportional tohead velocity . 3.4 Physiology and Functional Organization of the Semicircular Canals The free surface of each hair cell is differentiated into 40–70 stereocilia and a single kinocilium. The kinocilium is always found on one side of the hair bundle, givingeach hair cell a morphological axis of polarity . The hair cells release transmitter ton-ically . Bending of the stereocilia toward the kinocilium leads to depolarization of the hair cell, an increase in the release of transmitter, and an increase in ﬁring of theafferent ﬁbers. Conversely , bending of the stereocilia away from the kinocilium leadsto hyperpolarization of the hair cell, a decrease in the release of transmitter, and a decrease in ﬁring of the afferent ﬁbers. For example, as the head rotates to the left, the endolymph ﬂuid in the canals lags behind the movement of the head because of inertia. As a result, the ﬂuid in the leftcanal deﬂects the stereocilia in the direction of their axes of polarity , leading to de-polarization and excitation of the left vestibular nerve. At the same time, the ﬂuid inthe right canal deﬂects the stereocilia against their axes of polarity , leading to hyper-polarization and inhibition of the right vestibular nerve. The brain thus receives twoinputs from a leftward head rotation: an increase in ﬁring of vestibular nerve on theleft side, and a decrease in ﬁring on the right side. The right and left horizontal canals work as a functional pair because they lie in ap- proximately the same plane. However, the anterior canal on one side lies approxi-mately in the same plane as the posterior canal on the opposite side, so the anteriorand posterior canals of either side are functional pairs. For example, a chin-down(pitch) head rotation 45° to the right of the mid-sagittal plane will activate the rightanterior canal and inhibit the left posterior canal."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"This push–pull arrangement allows for functional recovery in the event of lesion on one side. The brain can continue to detect head rotation to the lesioned side by using information from the normal decrease in activity of the intact side. Thus, al-though acute unilateral lesion of the labyrinth causes nystagmus (see sections 3.5and 3.6) and vertigo, these symptoms often subside within days because a centralcompensatory mechanism restores the balance between the right and left side. If theother labyrinth is damaged after recovery from a unilateral lesion, a new imbalanceoccurs as if the previously damaged labyrinth were left intact. This results in nystag-mus and vertigo in the opposite direction from before, which gradually subside withcentral compensation. Notice that this second bout of nystagmus, called Bechterew nystagmus, only occurs if the labyrinths on both sides are damaged sequentially . If the labyrinths are damaged at the same time, there will be no imbalance between the right and left side and hence no nystagmus. 30 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Physiology and Functional Organization of the Semicircular Canals HyperpolarizationDepolarization Receptor potential Action potentialHair Cells Vestibular  nerveKinociliumStereocilia The right anterior and the left posterior canals work as a functional pair (and vice versa) ■The anterior canal on one side lies approxi- mately in the same plane as the posteriorcanal on the opposite side, so the anteriorand posterior canals of either side are func- tional pairs. ■For example, a chin-down (pitch) head rota- tion 45° to the right of the mid-sagittal planewill activate the right anterior canal (AC) andinhibit the left posterior canal (PC).Redrawn from Leigh RJ, Zee DS.The Neurology ofEye Movements. 3rd ed.

Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 31 3.5 The Horizontal VOR Pathway A three- to four-neuron arc connects the semicircular canals to the extraocular mus- cles. Primary afferents of the horizontal VOR pathway originate from the horizontal(lateral) canals. Stimulation of a horizontal canal by ipsilateral head acceleration re-sults in slow movements of both eyes away from the side of the canal."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"For example,a head rotation to the right stimulates the right (ipsilateral) horizontal canal, whichleads to activation of the left lateral rectus and right medial rectus, so that both eyesrotate to the left (i.e., contralateral slow phase). At the same time, inhibitory signalsare sent to the left medial rectus and right lateral rectus (i.e., the antagonist muscles). The horizontal angular VOR is served by two projections. The ﬁrst is a direct excita- tory projection from the horizontal canal to second-order neurons in the medialvestibular nucleus (MVN). Axons of these second-order neurons then project to thecontralateral abducens nucleus. T wo populations of neurons lie within the abducensnucleus: the abducens motoneurons , which innervate the lateral rectus on that side, forming a three-neuron arc, and the abducens internuclear neurons , the ax- ons of which cross the midline and ascend within the medial longitudinal fasciculus(MLF) to innervate the medial rectus motoneurons in the oculomotor nucleus on theopposite side. This internuclear pathway to the medial rectus muscle forms a four-neuron arc and is thought to be the most important VOR pathway to the medial rec-tus. This arc also transmits saccadic and pursuit eye movement signals to the medialrectus. Thus, axons from the two populations of neurons within the abducens nu-cleus project simultaneously to the ipsilateral lateral rectus and contralateral medialrectus (a yoked muscle pair). This arrangement provides the anatomical and physio-logical basis for Hering’s law. A second direct excitatory pathway arises from the horizontal canals and projects to second-order neurons in the lateral vestibular nucleus. Axons of these second-order neurons project to the ipsilateral abducens nucleus without synapsing. Theyascend through the ascending tract of Deiters (ATD) to the ipsilateral medial rectussubnucleus. In addition to sending excitatory projections to the agonist muscles, the horizontal canal sends reciprocal inhibitory projections to the antagonist muscles—that is, theipsilateral lateral rectus and contralateral medial rectus. This arrangement providesthe anatomical and physiological basis for Sherrington’s law."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The nystagmus caused by a unilateral peripheral vestibular lesion that involves the horizontal VOR pathway can be explained by the push–pull arrangement betweenthe horizontal canals on each side. In the normal resting state (head immobile), thetonic discharge from the canals on each side is equal and balanced. If the left hori-zontal canal is damaged, discharge from the left horizontal canal is reduced, whilethe discharge from the right horizontal canal remains at the same tonic level. Thiscreates a static imbalance between the canals such that the action of the right hori-zontal canal becomes unopposed, causing a tonic bias for the eyes to turn to the left.This results in a vestibular nystagmus with slow phases that move the eyes towardthe left (ipsilesional) and corrective quick phases that move the eyes toward the right(contralesional). 32 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems The Horizontal VOR Pathway Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 33RHC = right horizontal canal MVN = medial vestibular nucleusLVN = lateral vestibular nucleusMLF = medial longitudinal  fasciculus ATD = ascending tract of DietersIII, IV, VI = third, fourth, sixth nerve  nucleus MR, LR = medial, lateral rectusHorizontal Canal (HC) Excitatory LR MR RHC LVN MVNATD MLFIII IV VIRight eye Left eyeInhibitory LR MR RHC MVNMLFHead rotation to the right Right eye Left eye Head rotation to the right stimulates the right (ipsilateral) horizontal canal (RHC), which leads to activation of the left lateral rectus (LR) and right medial rectus (MR),so that both eyes rotate to the left (i.e., contralateral slow phase).

Slow phases to the right (i.e. left-beating nystagmus) Cold water into right ear  3.6 The Vertical and Torsional VOR Pathway Primary afferents of the vertical and torsional angular VOR pathway originate from the anterior and posterior canals. When one anterior (or posterior) canal is stimu-lated, the posterior (or anterior) canal in the opposite labyrinth is inhibited. Primary afferents from the anterior canal project to second-order neurons in the su- perior vestibular nucleus (SVN). Axons of these second-order neurons project to thecontralateral oculomotor nucleus, via the brachium conjunctivum, to excite the ipsi-lateral superior rectus and the contralateral inferior oblique (basis for Hering’s law).Thus the anterior canal activates elevation and contralateral torsion of the upperpoles of both eyes. At the same time, the anterior canal sends reciprocal inhibitorysignals to the SVN, the axons of which ascend via the MLF to innervate the antago-nist muscles; that is, the ipsilateral inferior rectus and contralateral superior oblique(basis for Sherrington’s law). Primary afferents from the posterior canal project to second-order neurons in the MVN, the axons of which project, via the MLF , to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus to ex-cite the inferior rectus and to the contralateral trochlear nucleus to excite the superioroblique (basis for Hering’s law). Thus, the posterior canal activates depression and con-tralateral torsion of the upper poles of both eyes."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Reciprocal inhibition is conveyed fromthe posterior canal, via the SVN and MLF , to the antagonist muscles; that is, ipsilateralinferior oblique and contralateral superior rectus (basis for Sherrington’s law). Stimulation of both anterior canals by downward head acceleration activates the up- ward angular VOR, whereas stimulation of both posterior canals by upward headacceleration activates the downward angular VOR. Stimulation of the anterior andposterior canals on one side during ipsilateral head roll activates the torsional angu-lar VOR, so that the upper poles of the eyes roll toward the contralateral shoulder. The nystagmus caused by a central vestibular lesion that involves projections from both anterior canals (or both posterior canals) can be explained by the push–pullarrangement between the anterior and posterior canals that act as functional pairs(i.e., right anterior and left posterior canals as a pair, and left anterior and right pos-terior canals as another pair). In the normal resting state (head immobile), the tonicdischarge from all four vertical canals is equal and balanced. If a central vestibularlesion causes disruption of posterior canal projections from both sides, the signalfrom the posterior canals is reduced, but the signal from the anterior canals remainsat the same tonic level. This creates a static imbalance such that the action of the an-terior canals becomes unopposed, causing a tonic bias for the eyes to rotate upward.This results in a downbeat nystagmus with upward slow phases. Empirically , the vertical VOR is biased, favoring the upward VOR which is mediatedby the anterior canals. To ensure that the resting tonic discharge from all four verti-cal canals is equal and balanced, such that no spontaneous nystagmus occurs duringnormal ﬁxation, Purkinje cells in the ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus of the cere-bellum send more inhibitory projections to the anterior canal than to the posterior canal pathways in the vestibular nucleus. Lesion of the ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus removes this asymmetric inhibition, uncovering the underlying ante-rior canal bias. Thus, lesion of the ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus typically causes downbeat nystagmus."

For horizontal canals, stimulation of the right horizontal canal causes both eyes to turn to the left by acti-vating the right medial rectus and left lateral rectus, whereas stimulation of the lefthorizontal canal causes both eyes to turn to the right by activating the right lateralrectus and left medial rectus. For anterior canals, stimulation of the right anteriorcanal causes both eyes to elevate and rotate counterclockwise from the patient’spoint of view (that is, right eye incyclotorts and left eye excyclotorts), by activatingthe right superior rectus and the left inferior oblique. Stimulation of the left anteriorcanal causes both eyes to elevate and rotate clockwise (that is, right eye excyclotortsand left eye incyclotorts), by activating the right inferior oblique and the left supe-rior rectus. For posterior canals, stimulation of the right posterior canal causes botheyes to depress and rotate counterclockwise (that is, right eye incyclotorts and lefteye excyclotorts), by activating the right superior oblique and the left inferior rectus.Stimulation of the left posterior canal causes both eyes to depress and rotate clock-wise (that is, right eye excyclotorts and left eye incyclotorts), by activating the rightinferior rectus and the left superior oblique. The typical waveforms seen in peripheral versus central vestibular nystagmus can be explained by the combined effects of one or more canals on either side. Combinedinvolvement of all three canals on one side, as is often seen in a unilateral peripheral vestibular lesion , causes a mixed horizontal–torsional nystagmus. For example, a"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"combined lesion that affects all three canals on the left side (horizontal, anterior, andposterior) leads to a static imbalance such that the combined action of all threecanals on the right side becomes unopposed, causing a tonic bias for the eyes to ro-tate to the left and counterclockwise (from the patient’s viewpoint). This results in amixed horizontal and torsional nystagmus that beats to the right and clockwise. In contrast, a central vestibular lesion usually causes a purely vertical or purely torsional nystagmus. Pure vertical nystagmus can only be induced by simultaneousstimulation of the same vertical canal on both sides. For example, a central lesionthat affects the posterior canal projections from both sides leads to a static imbalancesuch that the combined action of anterior canal projections from both sides becomesunopposed. This results in a tonic bias for the eyes to rotate upward and hence adownbeat nystagmus. Pure torsional nystagmus, in contrast, can only be produced by stimulation of both the anterior and posterior canals on one side. For example, a central lesion that affects the anterior and posterior canals on the left side leads to astatic imbalance such that the combined action of the anterior and posterior canalson the right side becomes unopposed. This results in a tonic bias for the eyes to ro-tate counterclockwise (from the patient’s viewpoint) and hence a torsional nystag-mus that beats clockwise. 36 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Eye Movements from Stimulation of Individual and Combinations of Semicircular Canals Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 37Direction of arrows = direction of slow phase of both eyes RPC RHC RACRE LELPC LHC LACRE, LE = right, left eye RHC, LHC = right, left horizontal canal RAC, LAC = right, left  anterior canal RPC, LPC = right, left  posterior canal Examples 1.

Hair cells on the maculae have awide range of polarization vectors."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The cells in the utricular macula are oriented roughly in the horizontal plane, and, thus, the utricle is responsible for detectinghorizontal translation and static head tilt. The cells in the saccular macula , in con- trast, are oriented roughly in the vertical plane, parallel to the mid-sagittal plane.Thus, the saccule is responsible for detecting vertical translation, as well as statichead tilt. The directions of the polarization vectors are reversed across a central zonein each macula called the striola . Thus, the otoliths have a more complex structure than the semicircular canals, both in spatial organization and in the distribution ofpolarization vectors. The otolith organs suffer from a fundamental problem: they are unable to distinguish between tilt and translation. During head tilt , because the speciﬁc gravity of the oto- conia is greater than that of the endolymph, the otoconia are displaced in the direc-tion of gravity , causing the hair cells to bend toward the same direction as the headtilt. However, during linear head translation , the inertia of the otoconia and the en- dolymph causes the underlying hair cells to bend away from the direction of linearacceleration. Thus, for example, the same set of otolith hair cells that is activated bya head tilt toward the right ear is also activated equivalently by a translational accel-eration toward the left ear. Because the required ocular response to a tilt is a combi-nation of torsional and vertical eye movements, whereas that required for interauraltranslation is a horizontal eye movement, additional inputs or mechanisms are nec-essary for the brain to distinguish between tilt and translation. Physiologic evidence suggests that the brain can distinguish between tilt and transla- tion based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration input. Low-frequencylinear acceleration is interpreted as tilt, and high-frequency stimuli is interpreted astranslation. In addition, the “velocity storage integrator” network may also con-tribute by integrating angular head velocity signals detected by the canals to com-pute an internal estimate of gravity . Vestibular cells subsequently subtract this inter-nal estimate of gravity from the net gravitoinertial acceleration signal detected by theotoliths to make an internal estimate of translation (see section 3.13)."

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"known about the precise anatomy of the translational VOR (otolith–ocular) pathwayby which signals from the utricle and saccule reach the ocular motoneurons. The utricle–ocular pathway has usually been assumed to be disynaptic through the vestibular nuclei, which are analogous to the canal–ocular pathway . For example, be- cause of the inertia of the otoconia and endolymph, head translation to the left causes the stereocilia of the hair cells to bend toward the right, which leads to exci-tation of the hair cells that lie medial to the striola in the right utricle. Signals fromthe medial right utricle make excitatory connections to the ipsilateral vestibular nu-cleus, which then projects to ipsilateral abducens nucleus (this is in contrast to thecanal pathway , where the medial vestibular nucleus projects to the contralateral ab-ducens nucleus). The ipsilateral abducens nucleus in turn excites the ipsilateral ab-ducens motoneurons and contralateral medial rectus motoneurons, via the abducensinternuclear neurons, to generate compensatory eye movements to the right. There is growing evidence that this disynaptic pathway is weak and that polysynaptic pathways play a more important role. The polysynaptic pathways originate from the lateral side of the striola in the utricle ipsilateral to the direction of head translation(i.e., the left utricle in this example). Signals from the lateral side of the left utricle thenmake connections to the ipsilateral vestibular nucleus, possibly via an extensive net-work of projections within the cerebellum, including the nodulus and ventral uvula, aswell as the fastigial nucleus, the anterior vermis, and the ﬂocculus/ventral paraﬂoccu-lus. The ipsilateral vestibular nucleus then projects to the contralateral abducens nu-cleus to generate compensatory eye movements to the right. Polysynaptic pathways are also responsible for generating compensatory torsional eye movements during static head tilt. For example, because the speciﬁc gravity ofthe otoconia is greater than that of the endolymph, static head tilt toward the right"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"shoulder causes the otoconia and the stereocilia of the underlying hair cells to bendtoward the right, which leads to excitation of the hair cells that lie medial to the stri-ola in the right utricle. Signals from the medial right utricle make excitatory connec-tions to the ipsilateral vestibular nucleus, which then makes polysynaptic excitatoryconnections to the contralateral trochlear nucleus (and thence to the ipsilateral orright superior oblique) and polysynaptic inhibitory connections to the ipsilateral in-ferior oblique subnucleus to inhibit the ipsilateral (right) inferior oblique. At present, there is much less evidence for the involvement of the saccule, as op- posed to the utricle, in evoking reﬂexive eye movements. 40 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems The Otolith-Ocular Pathway Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 41To horizontal rectus muscles To oblique musclesConnections from the utricle to extraocular muscles Head Translation to the Left LR LR MR MR III IV VI Polysynaptic pathway (possibly via cerebellum) strong contribution Disynaptic pathway weak contribution  VN Scarpa's ganglion Otoconia movement Hair cells  in lateral  utricle inhibitedHair cells  in medial  utricle activatedHair cells  in medial  utricle inhibitedHair cells  in lateral  utricle activatedRE LE Right utricleLeft utricleIOSO SO IOIII IV VI VN Scarpa's ganglion Hair cells  in lateral  utricle inhibitedHair cells  in medial  utricle activatedHair cells  in medial  utricle inhibitedHair cells  in lateral  utricle activatedStatic Head Tilt to the Right Shoulder RE LE Right utricleLeft utricle- + Otoconia movement Otoconia movement Otoconia movement LVN = lateral vestibular nucleus VN = vestibular nucleus MLF = medial longitudinal fasciculus ATD = ascending tract of Dieters III, IV, VI = third, fourth, sixth nerve nucleusMR, LR, SR, IR = medial, lateral, superior, inferior rectus"

In ad-dition, stimulation of the left utricular nerve results in a left (ipsilateral) head tilt viaactivation of the ipsilateral neck ﬂexors and contralateral neck extensors. Skew deviation is a vertical strabismus caused by a supranuclear lesion in the brain- stem or cerebellum (see section 9.5.2). It has been attributed to an asymmetric dis- ruption of the otolith–ocular pathway . Abnormal ocular torsion, pathologic head tilt,and abnormal tilt of the subjective visual vertical may be associated with skew devi-ation, constituting the ocular tilt reaction (OTR). Acute peripheral vestibulopathy"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"can cause skew deviation and the complete OTR due to imbalanced inputs from theutricle. For example, a lesion of the right utricle or utricular nerve leads to a staticimbalance so that the action of the left utricle or utricular nerve becomes unop-posed. This tonic bias results in an ocular tilt reaction: hypotropia of ipsilesional(right) eye (i.e., skew deviation), excyclotorsion of ipsilesional (right) eye, and ip-silesional (right) head tilt. After the utricular nerve projects to the vestibular nuclei, the otolith–ocular pathway crosses the midline and ascends to the midbrain via the MLF to contact the oculo-motor and trochlear nuclei, as well as the interstitial nucleus of Cajal. Thus, a lesionin the MLF or midbrain causes a contralesional OTR. For example, a right MLF le-sion results in a left OTR with hypotropia of the left eye, excyclotorsion of the lefteye, and left head tilt. 42 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Eye Movements from Stimulation of the Left Utricular Nerve Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 43RE LE Stimulating the left utricular nerve results in: ■Left eye (ipsilateral eye): incyclotorsion (superior oblique) >elevation (superior rec- tus)>adduction (medial rectus) ■Right eye (contralateral eye): excyclotorsion (inferior oblique) >depression (inferior rectus) >abduction (lateral rectus) ■Left (ipsilateral) head tilt: activation of ipsilateral neck ﬂexors and contralateral neck extensors Clinical Points A lesion of the right utricular nerve leads to unopposed action of the left utricular nerve, and results in a right ocular tilt reaction, which is characterized by: 1.

Eye move- ments from single utricular nerve stimulation in thecat. Acta Otolaryngol. 1969; 68:350–62. 3.11 Gaze Orientation and Postural Stability Mechanisms In addition to generating compensatory eye movements during head motion, the otolith organs, together with the semicircular canals, control posture and register theorientation of the eyes and body in three-dimensional space. This is achieved by ori-enting the eyes, head, and body to the gravitoinertial acceleration vector (GIA), which is the vector sum of gravitational acceleration ( A g) and inertial (or linear trans- lational) acceleration ( Ai). In normal and pathological states, the torsional eye position is such that the eyes’vertical meridian is aligned with the GIA: 1. When the head is upright and stationary , the head’s vertical axis and the eyes’ ver- tical meridian are aligned with the GIA, which in turn is aligned with the gravita-tional acceleration vector A g. 2. When the head is tilted counterclockwise statically (from the subject’s viewpoint),the GIA remains vertical. The eyes compensate for the head tilt by rotating clock-wise, so that the eyes’ vertical meridian is realigned with the GIA. At the same time,the right eye depresses and the left eye elevates, so that the eyes’ horizontal meridianis realigned with earth-horizontal. 3. When the head is translating to the right, the sum of A gand Aicauses the GIA to tilt to the right, so that the GIA is no longer vertical. The eyes compensate by rotat- ing clockwise, so that the eyes’ vertical meridian is realigned with the new GIA."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Atthe same time, both eyes rotate to the left to maintain ﬁxation and compensate forthe rightward head translation. 4. A lesion of the right otolith tilts the GIA to the right so that the patient’s internal estimate of absolute vertical (gravity) is abnormally tilted to the right. In otherwords, the brain erroneously registers that the patient’s head is tilted to the left. Thisresults in a right OTR, which consists of a triad of abnormal head tilt to the right torealign the head’s vertical axis with the new but abnormal GIA; clockwise rotation ofthe eyes to realign the eyes’ vertical meridian with the new but abnormal GIA; andskew deviation (i.e., the right eye depresses and the left eye elevates) to realign theeyes’ horizontal meridian with the new but abnormal internal estimate of the earth-horizontal. Thus, in all four instances, the otolith–ocular reﬂex rolls the eyes toward the GIA. This mechanism is paralleled by the vestibulo-collic reﬂex, which orients the head to correspond to alterations in the GIA in space, as well as the vestibulo-spinal re- ﬂex, which readjusts the positions of the limbs to counter the alterations in the GIA and maintain postural stability . 44 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Gaze Orientation and Postural Stability Mechanisms Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 45In normal and pathological states, the torsional eye position is such that the eyes’ vertical meridian is aligned with the GIA, which is the vector sum of gravitational ac-celeration ( A g) and inertial (or linear translational) acceleration ( Ai).

It can nevertheless change to meet prevailing environmental circumstances. These changes may occur immedi-ately or after several days to weeks and are classiﬁed as habituation and adaptation. Although vision is the stimulus for many adaptive changes of VOR performance, the VOR may also show habituation , a reduction of response after repetitive stimulation in complete darkness. Habituation is most evident after repeated constant-velocityor low-frequency continuous oscillations."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The functional signiﬁcance of habituationis uncertain, although it may contribute to eliminating the spontaneous nystagmusthat occurs after a unilateral labyrinthine lesion. Removal of the nodulus and uvulain monkeys prevents habituation and reverses habituation once it has occurred. The VOR is an open-loop control system, meaning that the labyrinthine receptors, which provide the input of the reﬂex, receive no information about eye movements,the output of the reﬂex. In the absence of rapid feedback, the VOR must be contin-uously calibrated by short- and long-term adaptations to correct for any errors in-duced by visual or vestibular changes. These errors are sensed by vision, which re-calibrates the VOR by a process called motor learning or VOR adaptation . Adaptive changes in the VOR occur in response to certain visual stimuli. For exam-ple, due to rotational magniﬁcation, wearing magnifying glasses causes the angularVOR gain and the translational VOR sensitivity to increase, because the retinal imageslip caused by magnifying glasses increases the amplitude of the eye movement rela-tive to that of the head. Thus, a farsighted (hyperopic) person who habitually wearsplus lenses has a higher VOR gain than an emmetropic person. Conversely , a near-sighted (myopic) person who habitually wears minus lenses has a lower gain. Indi-viduals who wear contact lenses have no changes in gain because there is no rota-tional magniﬁcation or change in retinal image displacement. More dramatic changes in VOR occur when subjects wear reversing prisms that lat- erally invert the world such that a head turn causes the environment to appear tomove in the same direction as the head turn. After a short adaptation period, theeyes rotate in the same direction as the head (rather than in the opposite direction)to stabilize retinal image. Cross-axis adaptation also occurs in the VOR. When thehead is rotated horizontally (about the yaw axis) while a visual display is synchro-nously rotated vertically (about the pitch axis), after a short training period, hori-zontal head rotations in darkness elicit vertical eye movements. The sites of motor learning or VOR adaptation must be at points of convergence of"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"visual and vestibular inputs, where visual–vestibular mismatch, in the form of reti-nal image slip, can recalibrate the VOR. This convergence occurs in the ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus , and in the vestibular nucleus . The ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus receive vestibular input from the vestibular nuclei via mossy ﬁbers andvisual input from the inferior olivary nucleus via climbing ﬁbers, whereas the ﬂoc-culus target neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus receive input from the ﬂoccu-lus and paraﬂocculus. Thus, a lesion of the ﬂocculus and paraﬂocculus impairs VORadaptation (see section 10.1.1). The y-group in the medulla may also contribute tovertical VOR adaptation (see section 9.2.3). 46 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems VOR Adaptation and the Cerebellum Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 47The vestibulocerebellum Flocculus and paraflocculus Nodulus and uvula Inferior anterior surface of the cerebellum Effects of visual stimuli 1.

Clinical Point Lesion of the ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus impairs VOR adaptation (see section 10.1.1). 3.13 Velocity Storage of the VOR During sustained constant-velocity rotation ( >10 sec), the hair cells are initially de- ﬂected, but they soon return to their resting position. The return of the hair cells to the resting position and the decline in activity of the vestibular nerve has a time con- stant , deﬁned as the time required for a response to decline to 37% of its initial value, of about 5 sec. However, the VOR response (i.e., activity of vestibular neuronsand compensatory eye movements) decays with a time constant of about 15 sec.Therefore, a central vestibular mechanism, called velocity storage , must have stored the activity from the hair cells to prolong VOR duration threefold. The velocity storage mechanism is located in the superior and medial vestibular nuclei , and in the vestibular commissure, which contains ﬁbers that connect the medial vestibular nuclei on both sides. The velocity storage mechanism enhances VOR response to low-frequency head movements ( <0.03 Hz). It is also responsible for generating post-rotatory nystagmus, as well as optokinetic after-nystagmus (seesection 3.14). The velocity storage mechanism may also provide extraotolith signalsto distinguish between tilt and translation by computing an internal estimate of grav-ity (see section 3.8). Velocity storage operates only during horizontal head rotation. During vertical or torsional head rotations, the VOR response declines with a time constant of about7 sec, which is about the same as that of the vestibular afferents. Purkinje cells in the nodulus of the cerebellum send inhibitory projections to the vestibular nucleus. A lesion of the nodulus removes this inhibition, resulting in an"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"unstable velocity storage integrator. Thus, a lesion of the nodulus typically causesperiodic alternating nystagmus in the dark. Periodic alternating nystagmus occurs in light and dark if the ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus are also lesioned, by impairing visual ﬁxation (see sections 7.5.5 and 10.1.2). 48 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 49Velocity Storage of the VOR Rotation startsSlow  phase velocityEye velocity (time constant = 15 sec) Cupula & vestibular nerve firing rate (time constant = 5 sec)Sustained constant-velocity rotation in the dark The velocity storage mechanism ■During sustained constant-velocity rotation, the hair cells are initially deﬂected, but they soon return to their resting position. ■The return of the hair cells to the resting position and the decline in activity of thevestibular nerve has a time constant of about 5 sec (time constant is deﬁned as the time required for a response to decline to 37% of its initial value). ■The VOR response (i.e., activity of vestibular neurons and compensatory eye move-ments) decays with a time constant of about 15 sec. ■A central vestibular mechanism, called velocity storage , must have stored the ac- tivity from the hair cells to prolong VOR duration threefold.

If the ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus are lesioned so that visual ﬁxation is impaired, periodic alternating nystagmus occurs in light and dark (seesections 7.5.5 and 10.1.2). 3.14 The Optokinetic System Optokinetic nystagmus is induced reﬂexively by motion of a large visual scene, which causes an illusionary sensation of self-rotation ( circularvection ) in the oppo- site direction. The function of the optokinetic system is to supplement the angular VOR. Whereas the angular VOR responds best to brief, high-frequency head rotation, the optoki-netic system maintains retinal image stability during sustained, low-frequency rota-tion. In the laboratory , during sustained head rotation in the dark, vestibular nystagmus (VN) subsides over about 60 sec as the cupula returns to its original position. If therotation is suddenly stopped, post-rotatory vestibular nystagmus (PVN) begins with slow phases in the opposite direction. In another rather artiﬁcial situation whena normal subject sits with the head still inside a large, patterned, revolving drum(i.e., rotation of surroundings in light with the head stationary), optokinetic nys- tagmus develops. If the lights are suddenly turned off, the nystagmus does not stop immediately but gradually fades away as optokinetic after-nystagmus (OKAN). Ve- locity storage, discussed in section 3.13, is responsible for both post-rotatory nys- tagmus and OKAN. During the more natural situation when the head rotates in light,such that the environment sweeps across the retina in the opposite direction to headrotation, the nystagmus is the sum of VN and OKN. Thus, the optokinetic systemsustains retinal image stability after the vestibular responses have ceased. If the rota-tion is suddenly stopped, PVN is balanced by OKAN, and no nystagmus occurs."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Vi-sual ﬁxation also helps eliminate the post-rotatory nystagmus by shortening the timeconstant of velocity storage, a process called visual dumping. Smooth pursuit and optokinetic responses are often activated simultaneously in nat-urally occurring situations, but the two systems are distinct. Whereas smooth pur-suit is elicited voluntarily or induced by small objects whose images are guided tothe foveal or parafoveal retina, OKN is induced reﬂexively by motion of a large visualscene that stimulates a large area of the retina. The smooth pursuit and optokineticsystems share similar neural pathways. Small, handheld drums or tapes used in theclinic do not elicit circularvection or OKAN. Both the smooth pursuit and optoki-netic systems contribute to the optokinetic nystagmus evoked by such smaller ﬁeld stimulation. Just as the optokinetic smooth eye movements supplement the angular VOR during head rotation, an optokinetic subsystem, called ocular following response (OFR), supplements the linear VOR during head translation. The OFR has a very short la-tency and responds best to movement of large objects subtending about 40° of thevisual ﬁeld. It is enhanced when the background visual scene moves in the oppositedirection. 50 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 3 The Vestibular and Optokinetic Systems 51The Optokinetic SystemSlow phase eye velocity VN + OKN PVN + OKAN =  no nystagmus10 secC.

To test for static imbalance , ﬁrst inspect the eyes for primary position nystagmus while the patient ﬁxes a distant target with the head stationary . In patients with pe- ripheral vestibular disorders, the nystagmus usually has a mixed horizontal- torsional waveform (see section 3.7). Because peripheral vestibular nystagmus is of-ten suppressed by visual ﬁxation, the nystagmus may only be seen after ﬁxation hasbeen removed. Fixation can be removed in two ways."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The ﬁrst method is to have thepatient wear a pair of Frenzel goggles. These goggles contain plus lenses that magnifythe eyes, thus facilitating examination and effectively preventing the patients fromﬁxing on anything in the environment. However, Frenzel goggles may not be readilyavailable in the clinic, and they are expensive. The second way to remove ﬁxation isby using the ophthalmoscope. While the examiner views the optic nerve head in oneeye with the ophthalmoscope, occluding the fellow eye provides a sensitive methodto detect nystagmus without ﬁxation. Note that because the optic nerve head is be-hind the center of rotation of the eye, the direction of movement of the optic nervehead is opposite the direction of the nystagmus (which we observe by inspecting alandmark on the eye in front of the center of rotation). In contrast to peripheralvestibular nystagmus, the nystagmus in patients with central vestibular disorders usually has a purely vertical or purely torsional waveform (see section 3.7). Becausecentral vestibular nystagmus is not suppressed by visual ﬁxation, the nystagmus ispresent with or without ﬁxation. 2. To test for dynamic imbalance , the head thrust/impulse test is performed. This test is particularly useful for identifying malfunction of a single canal in patients with peripheral vestibular disorder. The patient is asked to ﬁx upon a distant target.To test the horizontal canals, the examiner briskly rotates the patient’s head either tothe right or to the left. Normally , the subject will be able to maintain ﬁxation duringhead impulses in any direction. If the VOR is defective, the patient will not be ableto maintain ﬁxation and will need to make one or two reﬁxating saccades. For exam-ple, if, in response to a leftward head impulse, the patient makes a rightward saccadeto maintain ﬁxation, this indicates that the left horizontal canal is not functioningproperly . To test the vertical canals, the examiner briskly rotates the patient’s head inthe right anterior canal–left posterior canal or left anterior canal–right posteriorcanal planes (i.e., 45° from the mid-sagittal plane; see section 3.4) either forward orbackward."

Saccadescan be made not only toward visual targets, but also toward auditory and tactilestimuli, as well as toward memorized targets. Saccades can be generated reﬂexively ,and they are responsible for resetting the eyes back to the mid-orbital position dur-ing vestibulo-ocular or optokinetic stimulation. Saccades need to be fast to get theeyes on the target as soon as possible."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"They also need to be fast because our eyes actlike cameras with slow shutters—vision is so blurred during saccades that the eyeshave to move quickly to minimize the time during which no clear image is capturedon the foveae. Indeed, saccades are the fastest type of eye movements, and they areamong the fastest movements that the body can make. Saccade speed is not undervoluntary control but depends on the size of the movement, with larger saccadesattaining higher peak velocities. It has been estimated that we make more than100,000 saccades per day . The burst neuron circuits in the brainstem provide the necessary motor signals to the extraocular muscles for the generation of saccades. There is a division of laborbetween the pons and the midbrain, with the pons primarily involved in generatinghorizontal saccades and the midbrain primarily involved in generating vertical andtorsional saccades. However, because eye movements are a component of cognitiveand purposeful behaviors in higher mammals, the process of deciding when andwhere to make a saccade occurs in the cerebral cortex. Not only does the cortex ex-ert control over saccades through direct projections to the burst neuron circuits, italso acts via the superior colliculus. The superior colliculus is located in themidbrain and consists of seven layers: three superﬁcial layers and four intermedi-ate/deep layers. The three superﬁcial layers receive direct inputs from both the reti-na and striate cortex, and they contain a retinotopic representation of the contralat-eral visual hemiﬁeld. The four intermediate and deep layers are primarily related toeye movements, but they also contain representations of the body surface and loca-tion of sound in space. In addition to receiving inputs from the frontal cortex, thesuperior colliculus receives powerful inhibitory inputs from the substantia nigrapars reticulata of the basal ganglia. These inhibitory inputs must be suppressed be-fore the superior colliculus can drive a saccade. The cerebellum is important formaintaining saccade accuracy and for adaptation. 56 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Because the brainstem provides the immediate premotor signals for saccades, dam- age to the burst neuron circuits affects both reﬂexive and volitional saccades."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Be-cause the cerebral cortex is primarily involved in higher-order, “executive” control ofsaccades, damage in cortical areas usually results in abnormal volitional saccades.Damage in the cerebellum causes saccades to over- or undershoot the target; this isthe eye movement equivalent to limb dysmetria in cerebellar diseases. In this chapter, the functions and characteristics of saccades are described. The anatomy and physiology of the burst neuron circuits in the brainstem that are respon-sible for generating horizontal, vertical, and torsional saccades are then described. Therole of the cerebrum and cerebellum in the control of saccadic eye movements is alsodiscussed. Finally , some tests of the saccadic system that could be performed at bed-side are described. Chapter 4 The Saccadic System 57 4.1 Functions and Characteristics of Saccades Saccades are fast eye movements that bring the image of an object of interest onto the fovea. They consist of a hierarchy of rapid eye movements, from the most rudi-mentary form, quick phases of vestibular and optokinetic nystagmus, to reﬂexivesaccades made in response to the sudden appearance of a novel visual stimulus, tohigher-level volitional saccades. Saccades have several characteristics: 1. Saccadic velocity . In normal subjects, the peak velocity of saccades varies from 30 to 700°/sec for amplitude ranging from 0.5 to 40°. The larger the saccades, the higher the peak velocity . This relationship between saccade amplitude and peak ve-locity has been called the main sequence . It can be used to determine whether a particular eye movement is a saccade or whether a patient’s saccades are abnormallyfast or slow. 2. Saccadic duration . The duration of saccades is approximately linearly related to the amplitude. It varies from 30 to 100 msec for amplitude ranging from 0.5 to 40°.3. Saccadic accuracy . Small degrees of conjugate and disconjugate saccadic dysme- tria are normal. A small overshooting (hypermetria) tends to occur with small-"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"amplitude saccades, and a small undershooting (hypometria) occurs with largeramplitude saccades. The degree of dysmetria is normally about 10% of the ampli-tude of the initial saccade, but it is more prominent with increasing age, fatigue, orinattention. 4. Saccadic latency (initiation time) . The interval between the appearance of a target of interest and the onset of a saccade is normally about 150–250 msec. The introduction of a brief temporal gap of several hundred msec between the disap-pearance of an initial ﬁxation target and the appearance of a peripheral target (i.e.,the gap paradigm ) leads to a reduction in saccadic latency to about 100 msec; these short-latency saccades are called express saccades . Conversely , if the initial ﬁxation target remains while a saccade is made to a new target (i.e., the overlap paradigm ), saccade onset is delayed to 200–250 msec. The gap and overlap paradigms illustratethe effects of ﬁxation and attention on initiation of saccades. That is, disengagementof active ﬁxation and attention allows faster onset of saccades. In the clinical setting, each saccadic characteristic should be evaluated carefully be- cause different disorders may affect one characteristic more than the others. For ex-ample, slow saccades are typically found in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, whereasdysmetric saccades with normal velocity are typically exhibited in spinocerebellarataxia type 6. Patients with ocular motor apraxia are unable to initiate voluntary sac-cades, leading to extremely prolonged latency , but their reﬂexive saccades are unaf-fected. Saccade hypermetria is often observed in patients with cerebellar lesions. 58 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 4 The Saccadic System 59Functions and Characteristics of Saccades Function Saccades bring the image of an object of interest onto the fovea.

A pulse of innervation consists of a high-frequency burst of phasic activity in agonist motoneurons. Phasic contraction of the agonist muscle overcomes viscousdrag in the orbit and is responsible for the rapid eye movement."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Once the eye hasbeen brought to a new position, agonist motoneurons assume a new level of tonic in-nervation, higher than the resting level, constituting saccadic step of innervation, which holds the eye in its new position against orbital elastic recoiling forces. The saccadic step, an eye position command, is created from the pulse (an eye veloc- ity command) by a neural network that integrates, in the mathematical sense, conju-gate eye-velocity commands into the appropriate position-coded information for theocular motoneurons. This neural network is called the velocity-to-position neural integrator . For horizontal movements, the neural integrator consists of the medial vestibular nucleus and adjacent nucleus prepositus hypoglossi in the medulla. For vertical and torsional movements, the neural integrator is in the interstitial nu- cleus of Cajal in the midbrain. The neural integrator thus contributes to the gaze- holding mechanism, failure of which leads to gaze-evoked nystagmus. The cellgroups of the paramedian tracts (PMT) may also contribute to gaze holding by re-laying eye movement signals to the vestibulocerebellum. One component of thePMT cell groups is the medullary nucleus pararaphales, which receives eye positionsignals from the interstitial nucleus of Cajal. Thus, medullary lesions that damagethis cell group may cause upbeat nystagmus (see section 9.2.3). The pulse-step of innervation applies to all types of eye movements. When the dis- charge occurs for low-velocity eye movements (i.e., smooth pursuit, vestibular oroptokinetic slow phases, and vergence), the phasic increase is usually smaller thanthat required for saccades. From a pathophysiological standpoint, saccadic disorders can be the result of an ab- normal pulse, an abnormal step, or a mismatch between the pulse and step of inner-vation. For example, a decrease in the height of the saccadic pulse, which reﬂects theﬁring rate of the motoneurons, causes slow saccades . A decrease in the amplitude of the saccadic pulse (i.e."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"height [ﬁring rate] times width [duration of ﬁring]), leads tohypometric saccades ; conversely , an increase in pulse amplitude results in hypermetric saccades .8If the saccadic step cannot be sustained despite a normal pulse, for ex- ample, due to a defective or leaky neural integrator, the eye drifts toward the centralposition at the end of each eccentric saccade, resulting in gaze-evoked nystagmus with corrective quick phases beating away from central position.

Step. After a saccade, motoneurons and the agonist extraocular muscles assume a new, higher level of tonic activity , holding the eye in its new position against the orbitalelastic force, which tends to rotate the globe back to the mid-orbital position. The step (an eye position command) is derived from the pulse (an eye velocity com- mand). This is performed by the velocity-to-position neural integrator , which mathematically integrates a velocity command to yield a position command(gaze-holding mechanism ). ■For horizontal movements, the neural integrator consists of the medial"

Chapter 4 The Saccadic System 61 62 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems4.3 Brainstem Saccade Generation T wo classes of neurons in the brainstem are critical for the generation of saccades: burst neurons and omnipause neurons. Burst neurons are divided into excitatoryand inhibitory types. Excitatory burst neurons (EBN) are further divided into medium-lead burst neurons and long-lead burst neurons. Medium-lead (also called short-lead) burst neurons generate the immediate premotor command for the sac- cadic pulse by activating motoneurons that innervate the agonist muscles. They dis-charge at a high frequency to motoneurons, 8–15 msec before and during saccades,but they are silent during ﬁxation, pursuit, and vestibular and optokinetic eye move-ments. They reside within the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis in the pontineparamedian reticular formation (PPRF) for horizontal saccades, and in the rostral in-terstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) for vertical and tor-sional saccades. Long-lead burst neurons activate medium-lead EBN and inhibit omnipause neu- rons to release their tonic inhibition on EBN. They discharge irregularly for up to 100 msec before saccade onset. They are located predominantly in the rostral PPRFand the mesencephalic reticular formation. Inhibitory burst neurons (IBN) inhibit the motoneurons to antagonist muscles and discharge just before and during sac-cades. They reside within the nucleus paragigantocellularis dorsalis in the PPRF forhorizontal saccades. For vertical and torsional saccades, IBN reside in the interstitialnucleus of Cajal and possibly within the riMLF . Omnipause (pause) neurons tonically inhibit medium-lead burst neurons during ﬁxation and smooth eye movements."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"They stop discharging 10–12 msec before and during saccades. When a saccade is called for, the omnipause cells are inhibited,(possibly by long-lead burst neurons) so that their inhibitory effects are removedfrom medium-lead burst neurons to allow saccade generation. Omnipause neuronslie within the nucleus raphe interpositus in the PPRF . Model of Saccade Generation Saccades are initiated by trigger signals from the cerebral hemispheres and superiorcolliculi that inhibit omnipause neurons. Inhibition of omnipause neurons allow ex-citatory burst neurons to discharge. A desired eye position signal (e.g., retinal targeterror), independent of the trigger signal, determines how long the burst neurons ﬁre.The duration of their ﬁring determines the amplitude of saccades. The medium-leadexcitatory burst neurons generate an eye velocity command (the pulse), which is in-tegrated to create a new eye position command (the step) by the velocity-to-positionneural integrator. The pulse-step of innervation is sent to the motoneurons to moveand maintain the eye in a new position. Collaterals of medium-lead excitatory burstneurons also activate inhibitory burst neurons, which inhibit antagonist motoneu-rons and omnipause neurons during the saccade. Once the actual eye position matches the desired eye position, the burst neurons cease ﬁring, the omnipause cells resumetheir tonic activity , and the saccade stops.

The medium-lead excitatory burst neurons (EBN) in the PPRF generate an eye velocitycommand (the pulse) and project to the abducens nucleus."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"T wo populations of neu-rons reside within the abducens nucleus: the abducens motoneurons , which inner- vate the ipsilateral lateral rectus, and the abducens internuclear neurons , the ax- ons of which cross the midline and ascend within the medial longitudinal fasciculus(MLF) to innervate the medial rectus motoneurons in the oculomotor nucleus on theopposite side. This internuclear pathway also transmits vestibulo-ocular reﬂex(VOR) and pursuit eye movement signals to the medial rectus. The abducens andmedial rectus motoneurons activate the agonist muscles to move both eyes conju-gately to the desired eye position. The eye velocity command generated by the excitatory burst neurons in the PPRF is also sent to the velocity-to-position neural integrator, located within the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and medial vestibular nucleus complex (NPH-MVN) for horizontal saccades. The neural integrator mathematically integrates the eye velocitycommand to create an eye position command (the step), which holds the eyes intheir new position (i.e., gaze holding). Because the PPRF excites both populations of neurons in the abducens nucleus (ab- ducens motoneurons and internuclear neurons) and because it only carries saccadicsignals, a discrete lesion of the PPRF causes a conjugate horizontal saccadic palsy to the same side (see section 9.3.2). For example, a right PPRF lesion causes a con-jugate saccadic palsy to the right. In contrast, because the MLF carries not only sac-cadic signals, but also VOR and pursuit signals to the medial rectus, and because ax-ons of the internuclear neurons cross the midline almost immediately after leavingthe abducens nucleus, a lesion of the MLF causes an ipsilesional adduction palsy , which is the cardinal manifestation of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (see section 9.3.3). For example, a right MLF lesion (right internuclear ophthalmoplegia) resultsin adduction palsy , affecting adducting saccades, VOR, and pursuit of the right eye."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"lesion of the NPH-MVN complex (also called a “leaky” neural integrator) results infailure of gaze holding, that is, an inability to sustain the saccadic step despite a nor-mal saccadic pulse. The eyes thus drift toward the central position at the end of eacheccentric saccade, which is followed by a corrective saccade toward the eccentric po-sition, resulting in gaze-evoked nystagmus . Excitatory burst neurons in the PPRF (and the riMLF for vertical and torsional sac-cades) are tonically inhibited by omnipause neurons in the nucleus raphe interposi-tus. Empirical evidence shows that a lesion of nucleus raphe interpositus causes slow saccades (rather than involuntary saccades).

Lesion of NPH-MVN (“leaky integrator”) causes horizontal gazed-evoked nystag- mus because of failure of gaze holding."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Lesion of the nucleus raphe interpositus causes slowing of saccades.For horizontal saccades, excitatory burst neurons (EBNs) in PPRF send signals to: 1.Abducens motoneurons in the abducens nucleus, which generate a saccadic pulse to move the ipsilateral eye rapidly to a new position (ipsilateral lateral rectus). 2.Abducens internuclear neurons in the abducens nucleus, which send axons to the contralateral medial rectus subnucleus via the MLF . The medial rectus motoneurons then generate a saccadic pulse to move the fellow eye rapidly to a new position (theinternuclear pathway also transmits VOR and pursuit eye movement signals to themedial rectus). 3.

Medium-lead EBNs that generateupward and downward saccades are intermingled in the riMLF . Medium-lead EBNsresponsible for upward saccades generate an eye velocity command (the pulse) andproject via the MLF to the ipsilateral superior rectus and inferior oblique subnucleiof the oculomotor nucleus, with axon collaterals crossing within the oculomotor nu-cleus to innervate the contralateral superior rectus and inferior oblique subnuclei.Each riMLF , therefore, innervates all four elevator muscles in both eyes (i.e., both su-perior recti and inferior obliques). Medium-lead EBNs also send collateral axons tothe interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) bilaterally , which integrates the pulse into astep command and transmits it to motoneurons."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Medium-lead EBNs responsible for downward saccades project via the MLF to the inferior rectus subnucleus of the oculomotor nucleus and to the trochlear nucleuson the same side. Inferior rectus motoneurons innervate the muscle of the ipsilateraleye, and superior oblique motoneurons innervate the muscle of the contralateraleye. Each riMLF , therefore, innervates two depressor muscles, one in each eye.Medium-lead EBNs also send collateral axons to the ipsilateral INC, which integratesthe pulse into a step command and transmits it to motoneurons. Although the riMLF contains burst neurons for both upward and downward sac- cades, each riMLF contains burst neurons that discharge for torsional saccades inone direction only: the right riMLF generates conjugate clockwise saccades, and theleft riMLF generates conjugate counterclockwise saccades only (from the subject’spoint of view). The omnipause neurons located in the nucleus raphe interpositus cease ﬁring during vertical and torsional saccades as well as during horizontal saccades. Inhibitory burstneurons for vertical and torsional saccades reside within the INC and possibly theriMLF; they inhibit omnipause neurons and the antagonist muscles during saccades. Because excitatory burst neurons responsible for upward saccades project bilaterally to the oculomotor nucleus, whereas EBNs responsible for downward saccades proj-ect ipsilaterally to motoneurons of the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, isolated le-sions of the riMLF are more likely to selectively impair downward saccades. A uni-lateral lesion of the riMLF thus causes slowing of downward saccades and loss ofipsitorsional saccades (e.g., clockwise saccades are lost with a right riMLF lesion; seesection 9.4.1). In contrast, a bilateral lesion of the riMLF causes a vertical and tor-sional saccadic palsy in all directions. Empirical evidence shows that a unilateral le-sion of the INC (“leaky integrator”) causes torsional nystagmus with ipsilesionalquick phase such that the upper poles of both eyes beat toward the side of lesion."

Clinical Points Unilateral lesion of riMLF causes slowing of downward saccades and loss of ipsitorsional saccades (e.g."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"clockwise saccades are lost with right riMLF lesion; see section 9.4.1). Bilateral lesion of riMLF causes vertical and torsional saccadic palsy in all directions. Unilateral lesion of INC (“leaky integrator”) causes torsional nystagmus with ipsilesional quick phase (i.e., upper poles of both eyes beat toward the side of lesion). 4.6 Cerebral and Cerebellar Control of Saccades Cerebral Control of Saccades The saccade subregion of the frontal eye ﬁeld (FEFsac), the supplementary eye ﬁeld, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the parietal eye ﬁeld (PEF) and area7a in the parietal cortex, participate in the control of saccades. These areas initiatesaccades by sending trigger signals to the omnipause neurons in the pons, and theyencode saccade amplitude and direction. The PEF initiates visually guided (reﬂexive)saccades and projects to the ipsilateral superior colliculus and to the FEF . The FEFsac initiates volitional and visually guided (reﬂexive) saccades and projects to the superior colliculus (SC) directly and via the PEF . The FEFsac also projects tothe caudate nucleus, which sends inhibitory projections to the nucleus substantia ni-gra pars reticulata (SNpr) in the basal ganglia. The SNpr, in turn, sends inhibitoryprojections to the superior colliculus. The SNpr tonically discharges during ﬁxation,and when it pauses, it disinhibits the SC, which discharges before and during volun-tary and visually evoked saccades. Thus, the FEFsac has a powerful two-pronged ef-fect on the SC: one direct and the other through the basal ganglia (i.e., the caudateand SNpr). The FEFsac and SC project directly to the PPRF and riMLF in the brain-stem."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Each FEFsac and SC generates contralateral horizontal saccades, whereas ver-tical and torsional saccades are generated by simultaneous activation of both frontaleye ﬁelds or both superior colliculi. Together, the FEFsac and SC form an obligatory route for saccadic commands originat- ing in the cerebrum. A lesion of both the FEFsac and SC, but not either alone, causesdefective saccade generation. A lesion of either the FEFsac or the SC alone causes sub-tle abnormalities: mildly hypometric and delayed (increased latency) saccades. Cerebellar Control of Saccades The cerebellum regulates the size of saccades (dorsal oculomotor vermis and thefastigial nucleus) and participates in the repair of saccade inaccuracy (ﬂocculus andparaﬂocculus). The dorsal “oculomotor” vermis (lobules VI and VII) receives sac- cadic input from, among other structures, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontisand discharges before saccades. The nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis in turn sendsinhibitory projections to an ellipsoidal region in the caudal fastigial nucleus, thefastigial oculomotor region, which is important in the control of saccade accuracyand consistency . Projections of the fastigial nucleus decussate within the cerebellumto reach the brainstem, where they terminate onto burst neurons, omnipause neu-rons, and the rostral pole of the superior colliculus. The ﬂocculus and paraﬂocculusare important for the adaptation of the pulse and pulse-step mismatch for saccades. A lesion of the dorsal vermis results in dysmetric and slow saccades (i.e., hypomet- ric ipsilesional saccades and mild hypermetric contralesional saccades). A lesion of the fastigial nucleus also leads to dysmetric and slow saccades, but saccades are hy- permetric toward the side of the lesion (i.e., ipsipulsion; hypermetric ipsilesionaland hypometric contralesional saccades) because projections of the fastigial nucleus decussate within the cerebellum to reach the brainstem."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"A lesion of the ﬂocculus and paraﬂocculus results in postsaccadic drift because adaptation to pulse-step mis-match of saccades is lost. 68 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Cerebral and Cerebellar Control of Saccades Chapter 4 The Saccadic System 69FEFsac (a) = saccade subregion of frontal eye field SEF (b) = supplementary eye field  DLPC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex PEF (c) = parietal eye field LIP = lateral intraparietal area SNpr (e) = substantia nigra pars reticulata cNRTP (g) = caudal nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis PPRF (j) = paramedian pontine reticular formation riMLF (k) = rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculusFEFsac (a) SEF (b) DLPCFrontal Lobe  (Volitional & visually guided saccades) PEF (c) LIP / Area 7aParietal Lobe (Visually guided saccades) Superior Colliculus (f)  (ventral “motor” layersCaudate nucleus (d)SNpr (e) PPRF (j) & riMLF (k) in the brainstem-BASAL GANGLIA cNRTP (g) Dorsal vermis (h) Fastigial nucleus (i)CEREBELLUM b a dc ekf g j ih Dashed lines represent structures that  are normally covered by the cerebral cortex- ■Activation of the frontal eye ﬁeld (FEFsac) and superior colliculus (SC) on one side generates contralateral horizontal saccades. ■Simultaneous activation of FEFsac on both sides or SC on both sides generates ver-tical and torsional saccades.Redrawn from Leigh RJ, Zee DS.The Neurology of Eye Movements. 3rd ed.

Volitional saccades can be further divided into four categories: (1) saccades to command—saccades generatedon cue; (2) predictive, anticipatory saccades—saccades generated in anticipation ofor in search of the appearance of a target at a particular location; (3) memory-guidedsaccades—saccades generated to a location in which a target was previously present;and (4) antisaccades—saccades generated in the opposite direction to a suddenly ap-pearing target. Attention and volitional effort are especially demanded when makingantisaccades because reﬂexive saccades to the visual target must be suppressed. Saccades are best examined clinically by having a patient look alternately at two targets held apart horizontally or vertically , such as the examiner’s ﬁnger and nose. The veloc-ity , latency , accuracy , trajectory , and conjugacy should be noted. If a saccade abnormal-ity is identiﬁed, one should localize the disturbance within the hierarchical organiza-tion of saccades by assessing ﬁrst whether the most rudimentary quick phases areaffected. This can be done by spinning the patient in a swivel chair to elicit vestibularnystagmus or by using an optokinetic drum to elicit optokinetic nystagmus."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Loss ofquick phases is usually due to a lesion of premotor burst neurons in the brainstem. Next, determine if the patient can generate visually guided (reﬂexive) saccades bypresenting the patient with a suddenly appearing visual target. Then examine theability of the patient to make voluntary saccades in response to command by askingthe patient to make saccades rapidly between two stationary targets. Loss of volun-tary saccades with preservation of quick phases and visually guided (reﬂexive) sac-cades is characteristic of acquired ocular motor apraxia. Other voluntary saccades can also be tested. To test predictive, anticipatory saccades,the examiner holds both hands up and asks the patient to make a saccade when oneof the examiner’s ﬁngers moves. With predictable timing, the examiner moves ﬁrst aﬁnger on one hand and then a ﬁnger on the other and repeats this cycle several times.By occasionally not moving one ﬁnger, one can determine if the patient makes a pre-dictive saccade without a visual stimulus. Defects of predictive saccadic control arecommon in Parkinson’s disease. Antisaccades can be assessed by the examiner hold- ing both hands up and moving a ﬁnger on one hand suddenly . The patient is requiredto look away from the moving ﬁnger (i.e., to look to the ﬁnger that does not move).Errors on antisaccade tasks are common in lesions of the prefrontal cortex .

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Smooth pursuit consists of conjugate eye movements that allow both eyes to smoothly track a slowly moving object so that its image is kept on the foveae. For ex-ample, smooth pursuit eye movements are used when you track a child on a swing.Only animals with foveae make smooth pursuit eye movements. Rabbits, for in-stance, do not have foveae, and their eyes cannot track a small moving target. How-ever, if a rabbit is placed inside a rotating drum painted on the inside with stripes sothat the rabbit sees the entire visual ﬁeld rotating en bloc, it will track the stripes op-tokinetically . Humans have both smooth pursuit and optokinetic eye movements,but pursuit predominates. When you track a small, moving object against a detailedstationary background, such as a bird ﬂying against a background of leaves, the op-tokinetic system will try to hold your gaze on the stationary background, but it isoverridden by pursuit. Pursuit works well at speeds up to about 70°/sec, but top athletes may generate pur- suit as fast as 130°/sec. Pursuit responds slowly to unexpected changes—it takesabout 100 msec to track a target that starts to move suddenly , and this is why weneed the faster acting vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (VOR) to stabilize our eyes when ourheads move. However, pursuit can detect patterns of motion and respond to pre-dictable target motion in much less than 100 msec. Pursuit cannot be generated voluntarily without a suitable target. If you try to pur- sue an imaginary target moving across your visual ﬁeld, you will make a series ofsaccades instead of pursuit. However, the target that evokes pursuit does not have tobe visual; it may be auditory (e.g., a moving, beeping pager), proprioceptive (e.g.,tracking your outstretched ﬁnger in the dark), tactile (e.g., an ant crawling on yourarm in the dark), or cognitive (e.g., tracking a stroboscopic motion in which a seriesof light ﬂashes in sequence, even though no actual motion occurs). The neural pathway that controls pursuit eye movements is not completely under- stood."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Visual information is relayed from the striate cortex to the extrastriate areas,where neurons are specialized for motion, with large receptive ﬁelds, strong directionselectivity , and activity that encodes both target and eye motions. These extrastriateareas have projections directly to the brainstem, as well as to other cortical areas. Thecerebellum receives input from the brainstem and is critical in generating smoothpursuit. Recent evidence suggests that the pursuit system has a functional architecturesimilar to that of the saccadic system. Rather than being controlled primarily by areasin extrastriate cortex specialized for processing visual motion, pursuit involves an ex-tended network of cortical areas (e.g., frontal eye ﬁeld) and other subcortical struc-tures (e.g., superior colliculus and basal ganglia) that are also important for saccadiceye movements. Thus, although the traditional view is that pursuit and saccades aretwo distinct systems, it may be more accurate to consider the two movements as dif-ferent outcomes from a shared cascade of sensorimotor functions. Clinically , when pursuit fails to track a target, a series of catch-up saccades are ex- hibited. Because the smooth pursuit system involves many brain structures, pursuitdeﬁcits do not usually have any localizing value; other neurological and eye move-ment abnormalities are needed to pinpoint the location of a lesion. In this chapter, the functions and characteristics of smooth pursuit are discussed. The putative neural pathway that controls pursuit eye movements is then discussed. Finally ,some tests of the pursuit system that could be performed at bedside are described. 74 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 5 The Smooth Pursuit System 755.1 Functions and Characteristics of Smooth Pursuit Functions 1.

Cancels optokinetic nystagmus during tracking of a small, moving target against a detailed stationary background."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"For example, during smooth tracking of a bird ﬂy-ing against a background of leaves, the optokinetic system will try to hold the gazeon the stationary background, but it is overridden by pursuit. Characteristics 1.Velocity : 0.1–70°/sec (top athletes may show pursuit as high as 130°/sec) 2.Latency (initiation time) : 100–130 msec (i.e., much longer than VOR [about 15 msec], but shorter than saccades [about 200 msec]) 3.Gain: eye velocity/target velocity =1.0 (ideal) 4.Two phases of smooth pursuit : Open loop phase (pursuit initiation) : during the latency period ■Guided by target motion (i.e., retinal slip velocity) ■Initial acceleration (ﬁrst 20–40 msec) is very stereotypic and does not depend on initial target velocity . ■After this, there is a variable component in which pursuit acceleration depends on the initial target velocity . Closed loop phase (pursuit maintenance or steady state) : after the latency period ■During open loop phase, retinal slip is reduced to a fraction of target speed. ■To maintain pursuit, the brain adds an extraretinal feedback of eye velocity (i.e., an efference copy ) to retinal slip velocity to compute the target velocity . 5.Predictive character of smooth pursuit ■If target motion is unpredictable, pursuit shows a phase lag behind the target (about one latency period), as when tracking a ﬂying insect. ■If target motion is predictable, pursuit will track with no phase lag such that the object is perfectly centered on the fovea, as when tracking a child on a swing. 6.Stimuli for smooth pursuit ■Target velocity (i.e., retinal slip velocity; a velocity error) is the primary stimulus ■Position of target (a position error) ■Motor command to the eye (efference copy) ■Proprioception (afferent input) e.g., tracking one’s outstretched ﬁnger in the dark; also uses knowledge of motor command to the limb ■Perception of motion (requires high-level integration of many motion cues; e.g.,"

Signals from these cells are relayed through the magnocellular layers of thelateral geniculate nucleus to the striate cortex (area V1), from there to areas V2 andV3, and then to MT (middle temporal, area V5). Signals from MT are relayed to MST(medial superior temporal, area V5a) and to the visual motor area in the frontal (thesmooth pursuit subregion of the frontal eye ﬁeld and supplemental eye ﬁeld) and pos-terior parietal cortex (lateral intraparietal area). In V1, the information about motionis transformed by neurons that respond to particular directions of motion. These sig-nals are further elaborated in MT, where the ﬁring pattern of the population of neu-rons encodes the speed and direction of motion. Information about motion from MTis then extracted in MST. Both MT and MST, as well as the frontal eye ﬁeld, project di-rectly to the dorsolateral pontine nuclei (DLPN) in the ipsilateral basal pons. TheDLPN, in turn, projects to the contralateral ﬂocculus/ventral paraﬂocculus and thedorsal vermis in the cerebellum. The ﬂocculus and fastigial nucleus project to the me-dial vestibular nucleus (MVN) in the brainstem, which then projects to the contralat-eral abducens nucleus. The abducens nucleus innervates the lateral rectus on thesame side and, via the abducens internuclear neurons, innervates the contralateralmedial rectus. This constitutes a double decussation of the horizontal pursuit path-way . The ﬁrst decussation is the pontocerebellar projections from the DLPN, throughthe contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle, to the contralateral ﬂocculus/ventralparaﬂocculus and the dorsal vermis."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The second decussation is from second-ordervestibular neurons in the MVN to the contralateral abducens nucleus. In addition, thenucleus of the optic tract (NOT) receives projections from MT and MST and projectsto the DLPN. The NOT participates in horizontal pursuit only . Unilateral or bilaterallesions of NOT do not affect vertical pursuit. Putative Pathway for Vertical Pursuit Vertical pursuit follows the same pathway as for horizontal, except that it involves(1) the rostral nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis in the basal pons (instead of the DLPN), which receives input from MT, MST and the pursuit subregion of thefrontal eye ﬁeld and projects to the contralateral cerebellum, (2) the y-group (in- stead of the MVN), which projects to the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, as well asthe interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), and (3) the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum. Omnipause neurons in the nucleus raphe interpositus, which inhibit excitatory burst neurons for saccades during ﬁxation and stop ﬁring during saccades, also exert inhibitory control over pursuit. The nucleus prepsitus hypoglossi-MVN complex andINC perform integration, in the mathematical sense, for conjugate horizontal and ver-tical pursuit, respectively , by transforming eye velocity signals to eye position signals. The smooth pursuit and optokinetic systems share similar neural pathways and are often activated simultaneously (see section 3.14). 76 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 5 The Smooth Pursuit System 77LGN = lateral geniculate nucleus; V1 = striate cortex; V2, V3 = extrastriate cortex; MT = middle temporal visual area; MST = medial superior temporal visual area; FEFsem = pursuit subregion  of the frontal eye field; SEF = supplemental eye field; LIP = lateral intraparietal area; NOT = nucleus of the optic tract; DLPN = dorsolateral pontine nuclei; MVN = medial vestibular nucleus; LHC = left horizontal canal; NPH = nucleus prepositus hypoglossi; MLF = medial longitudinal"

When the gain islow, catchup saccades are seen, giving the appearance of saccadic pursuit. Con- versely , when the gain is high, backup saccades are observed. A useful clinical tool to test smooth pursuit is the handheld optokinetic drum. Al-though it does not adequately elicit optokinetic nystagmus, the optokinetic drumcan be used to assess smooth pursuit by rotating the drum in front of the patient inboth horizontal and vertical directions. The direction and nature of slow phases arethen analyzed. Pursuit asymmetry is commonly seen in cerebral hemispheric dis- ease."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"For example, a patient with a left posterior cerebral lesion may show fewer cor-rective quick phases when the drum is rotated to his or her left, due to low pursuitgain to the left. Pursuit reversal , which is corrective quick phases that beat toward the same direction as that of drum rotation, can be seen in some patients with infan-tile nystagmus syndrome. Because smooth pursuit cancels the VOR, smooth pursuit function can be inferred by testing VOR cancellation. This can be done by spinning the patient in a swivelchair while the patient ﬁxates on his or her outstretched thumb. Normally , the eyesshould be able to maintain steady ﬁxation. With inadequate VOR cancellation, theeyes are taken off target by VOR slow phases, which lead to corrective saccades. Forexample, deﬁcient VOR cancellation on rotation to the left corresponds to low pur-suit gain to the left. A lesion in MT and MST causes two types of pursuit defects: retinotopic and direc- tional (see section 11.3.3). A unilateral lesion in V1 or MT causes retinotopic pursuitdefects ( scotoma of motion ), which consist of lower smooth pursuit speed and in- accurate saccades in all directions in the contralateral hemiﬁeld. In contrast, a uni-lateral lesion in MST causes directional pursuit defects , which consist of lowered smooth pursuit speed toward the side of the lesion, regardless of the hemiﬁeldwhere the target lies; saccades are not affected. Lesions in the smooth pursuit subre-gion of the frontal eye ﬁeld (FEFsem), the DLPN, or the NOT cause deﬁcits in ip-siversive horizontal pursuit. A lesion in the rostral nucleus reticularis tegmenti pon-tis (rostral NRTP) causes deﬁcits in upward pursuit. Lesions in different areas of the cerebellum have different effects on smooth pursuit. Bilateral lesions of the ﬂocculus have no effects on pursuit."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Unilateral lesions of theventral paraﬂocculus (VPF) cause mild deﬁcits in horizontal and vertical pursuit(both directions) and VOR cancellation, whereas bilateral lesions of the ﬂocculusand VPF cause severe deﬁcits in horizontal and vertical pursuit (both directions) andVOR cancellation. Therefore, VPF is the primary structure involved in pursuit andVOR cancellation. Lesions of the vermis result in deﬁcits in ipsiversive horizontalpursuit, whereas lesions in the fastigial nucleus lead to deﬁcits in contraversive hor-izontal pursuit. Lesions involving the rest of the pursuit pathway (i.e., starting fromthe level of medial vestibular nucleus) will also affect the VOR because pursuit andthe VOR share similar pathways from this point forward. 78 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 5 The Smooth Pursuit System 79Clinical Testing of Smooth Pursuit 1.

Unlike other eye move-ment systems, vergence movements are disjunctive, meaning that the eyes move inopposite directions. To move from a far to a near target, the eyes converge (i.e., rotatetoward the nose) so that the lines of sight of the two eyes intersect at the tar get. To aim at a target farther away , the eyes diverge (i.e., rotate toward the temples). When the target is located at optical inﬁnity , the lines of sight are parallel."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"During deepsleep, deep anesthesia, and coma, the eyes diverge beyond parallel, indicating thateye alignment is normally actively maintained by the brain because the orbits, inwhich the eyeballs are located, are divergent. The vergence system is believed to be relatively new evolutionarily . Just as a new ver- sion of computer software tends to have bugs, perhaps it is for this reason that ver-gence is the last of the eye movement systems to reach full development in children,that it is often the ﬁrst system to be affected by fatigue, alcohol, and other drugs, andthat defective vergence is a common cause of strabismus and diplopia. Vergence eye movements are very slow, lasting 1 sec or longer. One reason for this may be that vergence, unlike saccades, is driven by visual feedback, which normallytakes at least 80 msec. Another reason may be that the speed of vergence movementsis limited by how fast the lenses change shape (accommodation) and how fast thepupils constrict. There may simply be no advantage for vergence to take placequickly and then wait for the lenses and pupils to catch up. The triad of conver-gence, accommodation, and pupillary constriction constitutes the near triad. The two most important stimuli for vergence are retinal image blur and retinal dis- parity . If the retinal image of an object is blurred, the target is either too near or toofar away . This results in a change in accommodation, which is accompanied by achange in pupillary size, as well as a change in vergence. Similarly , if a single objectcasts its image on noncorresponding points on the two retinas, vergence eye move-ments are elicited to realign the lines of sight to achieve single binocular vision. Whereas other eye movements can be directed along any meridian, vergence is most robust along the horizontal meridian. This is because the eyes are separated hori-zontally in the head, and so horizontal vergence is functionally most useful. Althoughvertical and torsional vergence can be elicited by vertical and torsional disparities,their amplitudes are much smaller than that of horizontal vergence. This explainswhy a vertical or torsional strabismus is often poorly tolerated. The neural pathway that controls vergence eye movements is not completely under- stood."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Binocularly driven neurons are present in the visual cortex and other brainareas, and no motor neurons are devoted exclusively to drive vergence. One canspeculate that these binocularly driven neurons must project to the oculomotor nu-clear complex, so that both medial rectus muscles are activated simultaneously togenerate vergence eye movements. Malfunction of vergence accounts for a number of common disorders. Convergence insufﬁciency causes diplopia at near distances and is commonly seen in young adultswho complain of eyestrain, periocular headache, and blurred vision after brief peri-ods of reading. Convergence insufﬁciency is also often found in patients withParkinson’s disease or progressive supranuclear palsy . An abnormal synkinetic rela- 82 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems tionship between vergence and accommodation is a common cause of childhood strabismus. In this chapter, the functions and characteristics of vergence eye movements are discussed. The putative neural pathway that controls vergence is then discussed.Finally , some tests of the vergence system that could be performed at bedside aredescribed. Chapter 6 The Vergence System 83 6.1 Functions and Characteristics of Vergence Eye Movements Vergence eye movements are disjunctive movements that move the eyes in oppo- site direction (i.e., convergence or divergence). They hold the images of a singleobject simultaneously on both foveae. Vergence eye movements have several char-acteristics: 1. Velocity. Vergence movements show two types of responses: (a) Fast vergence is observed in response to a large and abrupt change in disparity—for example, when one abruptly changes focus from near to far. (b) Slow vergence is seen in response toa small and slow change in disparity—for example, tracking a target that movesslowly in depth. Similar to saccades, peak velocity of vergence increases with its am-plitude (i.e., follows main sequence [see section 4.1]). Convergence speed is usuallygreater than divergence speed. 2. Latency . The latency of a vergence movement is about 200 msec for retinal blur stimuli and about 80–160 msec for retinal disparity stimuli.3. Waveform/trajectory. For convergence, the trajectory is one of increasing (exponen-"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"tial) velocity waveform, whereas for divergence, it is of decreasing (exponential) velocity waveform. The time constant is about 150–200 msec, reﬂecting the viscosity and elas-ticity of the eye muscles and connective tissues, and implies a step or tonic change in in-nervation. However, motoneurons actually show pulse-step discharge during vergence. 4. Vergence consists of two phases: (a) In the initiation (transient/open loop) phase , fast vergence is triggered in response to large retinal disparity with dissimilar features (shape, contrast, spatial frequency). This phase may be responsible for coarse stereopsis. (b) In the completion (sustained/closed loop) phase , slow eye movements complete the vergence response via negative visual feedback. This phaseresponds well to small disparity with similar features and may be responsible for ﬁnestereopsis. The horizontal fusional vergence system maintains correspondence ofretinal images in both eyes with precision but is not perfect. The remaining disparityis called ﬁxation disparity , which is a small residual disparity that acts as a steady- state vergence error to provide a negative feedback signal for sustained vergence.This small disparity is also responsible for stereopsis. 5. Vergence and saccade interaction. Most vergence eye movements are accompa- nied by disconjugate saccades, and saccades speed up vergence (several times faster). During horizontal saccades, the eyes transiently diverge and then converge, aligning30–100 msec after completion of saccades. During upward saccades, there is oftenan initial divergence, and during downward saccades, there is an initial convergence. 6. Stimuli for vergence. Vergence can be elicited by two primary stimuli: (a) retinal blur, due to loss of image sharpness, eliciting accommodative vergence ; and (b) retinal disparity , due to separation of images of a single object such that they fall on noncorresponding parts of the retina, eliciting fusional/disparity vergence . Other stimuli, such as (c) proximity of targets (i.e., proximal vergence; based on cues such as perspective); (d) change in size, or looming ; and (e) monocular cues"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"derived from motion , may also evoke vergence. There is also a resting level of ver- gence tone, called tonic vergence , about which changes in vergence induced by new sensory cues take place. Vergence can also be generated voluntarily . 84 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Functions and Characteristics of Vergence Eye Movements Vergence eye movements are disjunctive movements that move the eyes in opposite direction (i.e., convergence or divergence). Their function is to hold the images of a single object simultaneously on both foveae. Characteristics 1.Velocity ■Fast vergence is a response to a large and abrupt change in disparity (e.g., chang- ing focus abruptly from near to far). ■Slow vergence is a response to a small and slow change in disparity (e.g., trackinga target that moves slowly in depth). ■Peak velocity increases with amplitude of vergence (i.e., follows main sequence). ■Convergence speed is usually greater than divergence speed. 2.Latency ■Retinal blur stimuli: 200 msec ■Retinal disparity stimuli: 80–160 msec 3.Waveform or trajectory ■Convergence: increasing velocity waveform ■Divergence: decreasing velocity waveform ■Time constant: 150–200 msec (this reﬂects the viscosity and elasticity of the eyemuscles and connective tissue and implies a step or tonic change in innervation,but motoneurons actually show pulse-step discharge during vergence) 4.Two phases of vergence eye movementsa.Initiation/transient ■Fast, open-loop response that completes within a few hundred msec ■Responds to large disparity with dissimilar features (shape, contrast, spatial fre-quency) and may be responsible for coarse stereopsis b.Completion/sustained ■Slow response that completes vergence via negative visual feedback ■Responds to small disparity with similar features and may be responsible forﬁne stereopsis ■Fixation disparity: a small residual disparity for stereopsis and acts as steady-state vergence error to provide negative feedback signal for sustained vergence 5.Vergence and saccade interaction : Most vergence eye movements are accompanied by disconjugate saccades, and saccades speed up vergence (several times faster). 6.Stimuli"

In the stri- ate/primary visual cortex (area V1), three types of disparity neurons are present. (1)Tuned-zero/near-zero neurons respond to binocular stimuli over a narrow range about the ﬁxation point. They may be responsible for ﬁne stereopsis, and they provideinput for ultra-short latency vergence response (60–85 msec) to small disparities in alarge ﬁeld, which may help stabilize the visual scene during self-motion. (2) Tuned- far neurons respond to binocular stimuli that are farther from ﬁxation. They may be responsible for coarse stereopsis, and they provide input for vergence response tolarge disparities. (3) Tuned-near neurons respond to binocular stimuli that are nearer than ﬁxation. Like tuned-far neurons, they may be responsible for coarse stere-opsis, and they provide input for vergence response to large disparities. Other cere-bral areas that participate in vergence include the frontal cortex immediately anteriorto the saccade subregion of the frontal eye ﬁeld, the frontal cortex within the pursuitsubregion of the frontal eye ﬁeld, the lateral intraparietal area in the parietal cortex,the middle temporal (MT), and medial superior temporal (MST) areas. Brainstem Premotor and Motor Commands for Vergence Neurons in the supra-oculomotor area within the mesencephalic reticular forma- tion (MRF), 1–2 mm dorsal to the oculomotor nucleus, are involved in the control"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"of vergence, and they presumably send premotor commands to ocular motor neu-rons. Three main types of neurons are present in the MRF: (1) vergence tonic cells , which discharge in relation to vergence angle; (2) vergence burst cells , which dis- charge in relation to vergence velocity; and (3) vergence burst-tonic cells , which discharge in relation to both vergence velocity and angle. Some motoneurons in the abducens and oculomotor nuclei play a more important role in vergence. The medial rectus is innervated by three separate subgroups of mo-tor neurons. The cells in the dorsomedial part of the oculomotor nucleus (subgroupC) have the smallest cell bodies and innervate the tonic ﬁbers in the outer orbitallayer of the medial rectus. These cells are believed to be principally concerned withvergence movements. Cerebellar Control of Vergence The medial part of nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) in the basal pons contains neurons that discharge during vergence. The NRTP receives input from thefrontal eye ﬁeld and projects to the dorsal vermis and the nucleus interpositus in the cerebellum of monkeys (which corresponds to the emboliform and globose nu- cleiin humans). The dorsal vermis and the posterior nucleus interpositus contain neurons that discharge during far response. The dorsal vermis projects to the fastigialnucleus, which contains neurons that are active during near response. The ﬂocculus contains neurons that discharge in relation to the angle of vergence eye position. Lesions of the NRTP lead to impaired holding of vergence angle. Lesions of the dor- sal vermis result in esodeviation (excess convergence); whereas lesions of the fasti-gial oculomotor region lead to exodeviation (excess divergence). 86 Part I The Six Eye Movement Systems Chapter 6 The Vergence System 87Neural Substrate of Vergence Eye Movements FEFsac = saccade subregion of frontal eye field; FEFsem = pursuit subregion of frontal eye  field; PEF = parietal eye field; LIP = lateral intraparietal area; MT = middle temporal visual"

Ask the patient to ﬁxate on a small target as it is brought toward the nose. The NPC is the point at which fusion can nolonger be maintained and divergent movement occurs."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Convergence insufﬁciency, with abnormally high NPC, is commonly seen in Parkinson’s disease and progressivesupranuclear palsy . To test fusional vergence only , ask the patient to ﬁxate on a distant target. Put a hor- izontal prism in front of one eye to induce a fusional vergence movement, which isoften accompanied by a saccade. By progressively increasing the amplitude of theprism until diplopia occurs (the breaking point of fusion), one can measure therange of fusional amplitude for both convergence and divergence. The near triad consists of convergence, accommodation, and pupillary constriction. The AC/A ratio is the synkinetic relationship between accommodative-linked con- vergence and accommodation, and it normally ranges from 3 to 5. Accommodative vergence is often measured by the AC/A ratio. To calculate the AC/A ratio, ﬁrst per-form the cover–uncover test and use one of the following three methods: 1.Clinical method AC/A =(D n– Dd)/accommodation where Dnand Ddare deviation at near and at distance, respectively , and accommo- dation (in diopters) =(1/distance at near) – (1/distance at far). 2.Lens gradient method AC/A =(Dcc– Dsc)/power of lens where Dccand Dscis deviation with and without lens, respectively . 3.Heterophoria method AC/A =PD+(Dn– Dd)/accommodation where PD is pupillary distance in centimeters, and accommodation (indiopters) =(1/distance at near) – (1/distance at far). The CA/C ratio is the synkinetic relationship between convergence-linked accom- modation and convergence, and it normally ranges from 0.1 to 0.15. High AC/A ra-tio is usually associated with low CA/C ratio and vice versa.

This page intentionally left blank  Part II Nystagmus, Saccadic Dyskinesia,  Other Involuntary Eye Movements,and Gaze Deviations The word nystagmus comes from a Greek word for drowsiness or nod- ding, as in “nodding off to sleep."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The idea is that a drowsy person’shead shows the same alternating slow-quick pattern as ocular nystag-mus; the head of a drowsy person drifts downward slowly and thensnaps up in an attempt to regain wakefulness, before again resuming adownward drift. By deﬁnition, nystagmus consists of involuntary oscillations of the eyes that are initiated by slow eye movements. If both phases are sloweye movements, it is called pendular nystagmus. If one phase is a sac-cade (quick phase), which alternates with a slow phase, it is called jerknystagmus. Although the fundamental defect in nystagmus is animbalance of slow eye movements that drives the eyes off their target,the direction of nystagmus is conventionally named in the direction ofthe corrective quick phases that return the eyes toward their target.The slow-eye-movement imbalance may due to defects in thevestibulo-ocular, smooth pursuit, optokinetic, or gaze-holding sys-tems, or rarely in the vergence system. Saccadic dyskinesia includes saccadic intrusions and oscillations. These are abnormal fast eye movements that drive the eyes away from their tar-get and disrupt visual ﬁxation. Involuntary fast eye movements thatintermittently take the fovea off a target are called saccadic intrusions,whereas sustained abnormal fast eye movements are called saccadicoscillations. Some saccadic intrusions and oscillations have an intervalbetween sequential saccades (e.g., square wave jerks, macro-square wavejerks, square wave oscillations, macrosaccadic oscillations), whereas oth-ers do not. The presence of an intersaccadic interval signiﬁes the integrity of both pause cells that stop saccades and the neural integratorthat sustains eye position between saccades. Saccadic dyskinesia usuallyoccurs with lesions of the cerebellum or brainstem. Both nystagmus and saccadic dyskinesia move the fovea off target, which results in a decrease in vision. They also cause oscillopsia, anillusion of motion in the stationary environment."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"When examining apatient with oscillopsia, it is crucial to ask him or her whether theoscillopsia is present only during head movements or whether it ispresent with or without head movements. Oscillopsia that is presentduring head movements usually occurs in patients with bilateral per iph- eral lesions of the vestibular end-organs or nerves, or in patients withcentral vestibular dysfunction as a result of lesions in the brainstem orcerebellum. Oscillopsia that is present independent of whether the headis stationary or moving is commonly seen in nystagmus and saccadicdyskinesia. This condition may also be seen in patients with extraocu-lar muscle paresis because of abnormal gain of the vestibuloocularreﬂex, and rarely it is present with seizure or occipital lobe infarct (seesection 7.2 for differential diagnosis of oscillopsia). In this part, nystagmus is classiﬁed and discussed based on a patho- physiological approach (chapter 7).

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"phases beating in opposite direction to the gaze-evoked nystagmus when the eyesare in eccentric gaze, lasting for a few seconds (see ﬁgure on previous page). ■Rebound nystagmus typically occurs in patients with cerebellar disease and withexperimental lesions of the MVH-NPH. ■Both centripetal and rebound nystagmus beat in the same direction and may repre-sent an attempt by the brainstem or cerebellum to correct for the centripetal drift ofthe gaze-evoked nystagmus. ■Gaze-evoked, centripetal, and rebound nystagmus are seldom visually disabling unlesssevere because the eye drifts are minor when the eyes are close to central position. 7.6.4 Dissociated Nystagmus in Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia 8 Dissociated nystagmus occurs during gaze away from the side of the lesion: The ab-ducting eye exhibits an abducting centrifugal nystagmus (i.e., beating away from pri-mary position), while the adducting eye on the same side of the MLF lesion exhibitsa small or no nystagmus (see section 9.3.3). There are three possible explanations: 1. The abducting nystagmus may represent an attempt by the brain to adaptively cor- rect for hypometric saccades due to the weak medial rectus. By adaptively increasingthe innervation to the weak adducting eye, Hering’s law dictates a conjugate increaseof innervation to the abducting eye. This results in overshooting saccades and post-saccadic drift in the abducting eye. Because saccades initiate the oscillations, abduct-ing “nystagmus” is not a true nystagmus, but rather a series of saccadic pulses. 2. The abducting nystagmus is a dissociated gaze-evoked nystagmus caused by inter- ruption of the paramedian tracts, which are important for gaze holding. The nys-tagmus appears more prominent in the abducting eye because of adduction weak-ness in the adducting ipsilesional eye. 3. The abducting nystagmus is a result of an increased convergence tone, which leads"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"to centripetal drift of contralesional eye with correcting saccades. 7.6.5 Bruns’ Nystagmus Brun’s nystagmus is caused by cerebellopontine angle tumors (e.g., schwannoma ofthe eighth cranial nerve). This condition consists of ■Low frequency , large-amplitude horizontal nystagmus when the patient looks to-ward the side of lesion, due to defective gaze holding ■High frequency , small-amplitude nystagmus when the patient looks away from theside of lesion, due to vestibular imbalance 102 Part II Nystagmus, Saccadic Dyskinesia, Other Involuntary Eye Movements, and Gaze Deviations 7.7 Acquired Pendular Nystagmus 8 Characteristics ■Acquired pendular nystagmus is one of the more common types of nystagmus and is often associated with constant oscillopsia. It usually has horizontal, verti- cal, and torsional components with the same frequency , and one component maypredominate. In contrast, congenital pendular nystagmus is predominantly hori-zontal, with a small torsional and negligible vertical component. (See table onnext page) ■The nystagmus trajectory depends on the phase relationship between the differentcomponents. If the horizontal and vertical components are in phase, the trajectoryis oblique. If the horizontal and vertical components are 180° out of phase, the tra-jectory is elliptical. If the horizontal and vertical components are 90° out of phaseand have the same amplitude, the trajectory is circular. ■The nystagmus may be conjugate, disconjugate (sometimes appearing monocular),or disjunctive (convergent-divergent), but the frequency is usually the same in botheyes.

Treatment See section 7.9 for treatment. Acquired pendular nystagmus with visual loss ■Most commonly caused by optic nerve disease; may resolve when vision is restored ■In unilateral optic nerve disease, the nystagmus mainly affects the abnormal eye (monocular nystagmus), with a prominent vertical, low-frequency , pendular wave-form, and a less prominent horizontal jerk waveform. ■In bilateral optic nerve disease, the amplitude of the nystagmus is usually greaterin the eye with poorer vision (i.e., the Heimann-Bielschowsky phenomenon). TheHeimann-Bielschowsky phenomenon is also present with severe amblyopia, dense cataract, and high myopia. 104 Part II Nystagmus, Saccadic Dyskinesia, Other Involuntary Eye Movements, and Gaze DeviationsAcquired  Congenital  Pendular Nystagmus pendular nystagmus  Waveform Usually sinusoidal Variable Dissociation Frequent Rare (i.e., usually conjugate) between eyes (i.e., disconjugate or disjunctive) Direction Horizontal, vertical, Horizontal and uniplanar  or torsional (rarely vertical or torsional) OKN reversal or No Yes inverted pursuit Oscillopsia Frequent Rare OKN, optokinetic nystagmus. 7.8 Infantile or Developmental Nystagmus 7.8.1 Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome (Congenital/Infantile Idiopathic Motor Nystagmus) 8 Chapter 7 Nystagmus 105 1 secRight LeftCongenital jerk nystagmus Increasing velocity waveform Right LeftFoveation periodsCongenital pendular"

Foveation period (i.e., a brief [ <100 msec] period when the eye is closest to pri- mary position). Visual acuity is related to the duration of the foveation periods. 9. Reversed optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) and inverted pursuit: ■With an OKN drum, quick phases beat in the same direction as the drum rotation. ■Velocity signals may be processed incorrectly with an inversion of sign, leading to wrongly directed smooth pursuit commands. 10.

Management ■Cycloplegic refraction (astigmatism is frequently associated) ■Base-out prism stimulates convergence and may dampen nystagmus ■Kestenbaum procedure is a surgical procedure that places the null zone in pri- mary position.

This damage may include lesions in thebrainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain), cerebellum, and cerebrum(thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebral hemispheres). In this part of thebook, clinical–pathological correlations for supranuclear and internu-clear ocular motor disorders are discussed using an anatomic ap-proach. A number of structures in the medulla are particularly important for eye movement control. They include the medial vestibular nucleus andthe adjacent nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, which are critical for hori-zontal and vertical gaze-holding, as well as the inferior olivary nucleusand its projections, via the inferior cerebellar peduncle, to the cerebel-lum. Lateral medullary syndrome and oculopalatal tremor are the mostrecognized syndromes that feature prominent ocular motor abnormali-ties in lesions involving the medulla. Structures in the pons that are important for horizontal eye movements include the abducens nucleus, the paramedian pontine reticular forma-tion, and the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). In the midbrain,structures that are critical for vertical eye movements include the rostralinterstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the interstitialnucleus of Cajal, and the posterior commissure. Although lesions in thepons commonly cause abnormal horizontal eye movements, and lesionsin the midbrain commonly cause disturbances in vertical eye move-ments, this is an oversimpliﬁcation."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"For example, lesions in the pons thatdamage the MLF commonly cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia—acombination of adducting deﬁcit in the ipsilesional eye and abductingnystagmus in the contralesional eye. However, because the MLF also car-ries ﬁbers for vertical gaze-holding, smooth pursuit, and the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (VOR), bilateral lesions of the MLF in the pons also cause disturbances of vertical eye movements. The speciﬁc ocular motor ab- normalities seen in lesions in different parts of the brainstem are dis-cussed in chapter 9. Inﬂammatory , infectious, toxic, and degenerativediseases, as well as vergence disorders, in which supranuclear and inter-nuclear eye movement disorders are prominent are also discussed inchapter 9. Lesions involving the cerebellum cause abnormal eye movements in two ways. First, cerebellar lesions are often associated with damages inthe brainstem, which can produce cerebellar dysfunctions by virtue ofits projections to cerebellar Purkinje cells via the climbing ﬁber. Sec-ond, cerebellar lesions alone can also cause speciﬁc eye movement ab-normalities. Three principal syndromes are observed: the syndrome ofthe ﬂocculus and ventral paraﬂocculus, the syndrome of the nodulusand uvula, and the syndrome of the dorsal vermis and its underlyingfastigial nuclei. The main features of these syndromes are discussed inchapter 10. The manifestations of abnormal eye movements in cerebral diseases are varied. Thalamic lesions cause disturbances of both horizontal andvertical gaze. A number of conditions that affect the basal ganglia, in-cluding Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease, also cause ab-normal eye movements. The ocular motor disturbances that resultfrom lesions in the cerebral hemispheres depend on a number of fac-tors, including the duration (acute vs. chronic), size (diffuse vs. focal),location, and the laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral) of the lesions.Chapter 11 presents the speciﬁc ocular motor abnormalities seen in le-sions in different parts of the cerebrum."

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The abducting nystagmus may represent an attempt by the brain to adaptively correct for hypometric saccades due to the weak medial rectus. By adaptively increasing the innervation to the weak adducting eye,Hering’s law dictates a conjugate increase of innervation to the abducting eye.This results in overshootingsaccades and postsaccadic drift in the abducting eye. Since saccades initiate the oscillations, abducting“nystagmus”is not a true nystagmus, but rather a series of saccadic pulses. b. The abducting nystagmus is a dissociated gaze-evoked nystagmus caused by interruption of the paramedian tracts which is important for gaze-holding.The nystagmus appears more prominent in theabducting eye because of adduction weakness in the ipsilesional eye. c. The abducting nystagmus is a result of an increased convergence tone which leads to centripetal drift of contralesional eye with correcting saccades. 3. Possible explanations a. Downbeat nystagmus may be due to an upward bias from intact anterior canal (AC) pathways that do notpass through the MLF (i.e. posterior canal pathways pass through the MLF , but some AC pathways do not). b. Torsional nystagmus may be due to interruption of pathways between the vestibular nucleus and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC). 9.3.4 Combined Lesions in the Abducens Nucleus and MLF: One-and-a-half Syndrome Chapter 9 Ocular Motor Disorders Caused by Lesions in the Brainstem 135MLF = medial longitudinal fasciculus PPRF = paramedian pontine reticular formation VN = vestibular nucleus MR, LR = medial rectus, lateral rectus III, IV, VI = third, fourth, sixth nerve nucleusIII IVMR LR MLFPPRF VNHorizontal VOR &  pursuitHorizontal saccadesAffected area:  abducens nucleus& MLF (+/- PPRF) VI Eye Movement Abnormalities in Combined Abducens Nucleus and MLF  (with or without PPRF) Lesion: One-and-a-half Syndrome"

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Efferent pathwayThe Pupillary  Light Reflex Pathway ■The optic nerve carries monocular light information to the optic chiasm, where nasal retinal ﬁbers (temporal ﬁeld) decussate to the contralateral optic tract, and temporalretinal ﬁbers (nasal ﬁeld) remain uncrossed and continue in the ipsilateral optic tract. Clinical Point Lesion in optic tract causes a relative afferent pupillary defect in the contralateral eye be- cause the temporal visual ﬁeld is 60–70% larger than the nasal ﬁeld (see also section 12.3.1). ■Before synapsing at the lateral geniculate nucleus, some retinal ganglion cell axons that carry light-related signals leave the optic tract, enter the brachium of superiorcolliculus at the level of the midbrain, and synapse at the pretectal nucleus (the pre-tectal nucleus also receives input from the superior colliculus, which carries de-scending accommodation-related signals from the retina and cortical areas, includ-ing the lateral suprasylvian area, to the pretectal nucleus). ■The pretectal nucleus projects to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWN), a parasympa-thetic nucleus. ■The EWN then sends out parasympathetic ﬁbers, which travel along the ipsilateraloculomotor nerve and synapse at the ciliary ganglion. There are two subtypes ofparasympathetic ﬁbers: (1) pupillomotor ﬁbers (3%), whose cell bodies lie in theEWN caudally and innervate the iris sphincter, and (2) accommodative ﬁbers (97%),whose cell bodies lie in the EWN more rostrally and innervate the ciliary muscle.These two types of ﬁbers enter the eye via the short posterior ciliary nerves. Inpretectal syndrome , the lesion damages the pretectal (light) ﬁbers that enter the EWN caudally, sparing ﬁbers for near response (accommodative) that enter the EWN more rostrally.This results in light-near dissociation of the pupils. 9.4.4 Other Midbrain Lesions Central mesencephalic reticular formation"

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Nuclear and infranuclear ocular motor disorders are caused by lesions in theoculomotor, trochlear, or abducens nerves that may be located anywherefrom the ocular motor nuclei to the termination of the nerves in the extraoc-ular muscles. These disorders are common causes of diplopia. When exam-ining a patient with diplopia, the physician should ﬁrst establish whether thediplopia is monocular (present during viewing with one eye) or binocular(present during viewing with both eyes). Although exceptions do occur, as ageneral rule, monocular diplopia is usually caused by ocular diseases (whichrequire a detailed ophthalmologic examination to rule out any abnormalitiesin the cornea, lens, and retina), whereas binocular diplopia is usually causedby strabismus. If a patient experiences binocular diplopia, the physician should then es- tablish whether the diplopia is comitant (same degree of diplopia in dif-ferent gaze) or incomitant (diplopia that varies with gaze). Comitantstrabismus is common in childhood strabismus with no underlying neu-rologic abnormalities and is sometimes seen in patients with longstand-ing incomitant strabismus that secondarily becomes comitant over timedue to spread of comitance. Incomitant strabismus, in contrast, is usu-ally caused by either an innervational or mechanical abnormality . Inner-vational disorders can be further classiﬁed as those caused by supranu-clear or internuclear lesions, such as skew deviation and internuclearophthalmoplegia, and those caused by nuclear or infranuclear lesions,including ocular motor nerve palsy , peripheral neuropathy , disorders ofneuromuscular junctions, and disorders affecting the extraocular mus-cles. Likewise, mechanical abnormalities causing incomitant strabismuscan be further classiﬁed as those caused by a restrictive process (such asBrown’s syndrome), and those caused by other inﬂammatory , infectious, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and traumatic processes (see section 12.1 for an approach to diplopia). In this part, nuclear and infranuclear eye movement disorders are dis-"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"cussed, including oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsy (chapter12), peripheral neuropathy such as Guillain-Barré and Miller Fisher syn-dromes (chapter 12), disorders of neuromuscular junctions such as myas-thenia gravis and botulism (chapter 13), and disorders affecting the ex-traocular muscles (chapter 14). Although congenital ﬁbrosis of extraocularmuscles is traditionally believed to be a primarily mechanical or ﬁbroticprocess affecting the extraocular muscles, recent evidence suggests that ﬁ-brosis of extraocular muscles belongs to a group of congenital neuromus-cular disorders caused by developmental errors in innervation.

The oculomotor nerve fascicle The nerve fascicle passes ventrally through the medial longitudinal fasciculus, thetegmentum, the red nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and ﬁnally emerges from thecerebral peduncle to form the oculomotor nerve trunk, which lies between the supe-rior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries. The subarachnoid space The nerve then passes through the subarachnoid space, running beneath the free edgeof the tentorium. It continues lateral to the posterior communicating artery and be-low the temporal lobe uncus, where it runs over the petroclinoid ligament. It piercesthe dura mater at the top of the clivus to enter the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus Within the cavernous sinus, the nerve runs along the lateral wall of the sinus to-gether with the trochlear nerve and the ophthalmic (V 1) and maxillary (V2) divisions of the trigeminal nerve. As it leaves the cavernous sinus, it divides into the superior and inferior divisions, which pass through the superior orbital ﬁssure, and enters the orbit within the annulus of Zinn. The orbit Within the orbit, the smaller superior division runs lateral to the optic nerve andophthalmic artery and supplies the superior rectus and levator palpebrae muscles.The larger inferior division supplies the medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferioroblique muscles, as well as the iris sphincter and ciliary body . 202 Part IV Ocular Motor and Neuromuscular Tranasmission Disorders, and Extraocular Muscle MyopathiesThird nerve nucleus Red nucleus Cerebral peduncle Posterior cerebral artery Superior cerebellar arteryBasilar artery Petrous ridge Cavernous sinus Superior orbital fissureAqueductSuperior colliculus Sella turcica"

A midline unpaired structure called the central caudate nucleus that supplies the le- vator palpebrae muscle on both sides 2. Four lateral paired subnuclei that innervate the superior, inferior, and medial rec- tus, as well as the inferior oblique muscles 3. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which contains preganglionic, parasympathetic neurons whose axons project to the ciliary ganglion and ultimately control pupil- lary constriction and accommodation. Third nerve palsy caused by a nuclear lesion is rare. When it occurs, it produces spe- ciﬁc deﬁcits in both eyes because of the anatomy of the nucleus complex: 1. Superior rectus subnucleus: Axons from one superior rectus (SR) subnucleus cross and pass through the opposite SR subnucleus; thus, a lesion of one SR subnucleusresults in bilateral superior rectus palsy . 2. Central caudal nucleus: ■Unpaired and supplies both levator palpebrae muscles; thus, a lesion in the nu-cleus causes bilateral ptosis ■Located in the most caudal part of oculomotor nuclear complex, so it may be se-lectively affected (i.e., bilateral ptosis may be the only manifestation of a nuclearthird nerve palsy), or it may be selectively spared 3.

It is most often unilateral and sporadic, and there are no other neu-rologic or systemic abnormalities. It is characterized by ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, andpupillary involvement. The pupil is usually miotic, rather than dilated, because ofaberrant regeneration. Causes of congenital oculomotor nerve palsy are: 1. Absent or incomplete development of the nucleus, nerve, or both 2. Trauma (e.g., amniocentesis, birth injury) Other congenital syndromes involving the oculomotor nerve are described below. Congenital adduction palsy with synergistic divergence ■Unilateral adduction deﬁcit ■Simultaneous bilateral abduction on attempted adduction of the affected eye ■Pathogenesis: absent innervation of the affected medial rectus muscle with anom- alous oculomotor innervation to the lateral rectus Vertical retraction syndrome ■Limited elevation and depression of the affected eye, with retraction of the globeand narrowing of palpebral ﬁssure on attempted vertical movement ■Pathogenesis: anomalous oculomotor innervation of the vertical muscles in the af-fected eye Oculomotor paresis with cyclic spasms (cyclic oculomotor palsy) 8 ■Usually unilateral, present at birth, and persists unchanged for life ■T wo alternating phases: 1. Paretic phase—ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, mydriasis, and reduced accommoda- tion for about 2 min, followed by 2. Spastic phase—the ptotic eyelid elevates, the globe adducts, the pupil constricts, and accommodation increases for 10–30 sec ■Present during sleep (with reduced rate and amplitude) ■Voluntary eye movement efforts may inﬂuence the cycle (e.g., the paretic phasemay be prolonged with abduction effort, or the spastic phase may be prolongedwith adduction or accommodation-convergence efforts)."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"■Causes: congenital trauma or infections, posterior fossa tumor in acquired cases(very rare) ■Pathogenesis: injury to intracranial portion of the nerve results in retrograde degen-eration, such that the oculomotor nucleus contains two populations of neurons: 1. Normal neurons that are not injured or recovered completely . They transmit remnants of physiological movements. 2. Neurons that have been damaged but remain alive. They produce abnormal cyclic spasms by summation of subthreshold stimuli and rhythmic mass discharges. Chapter 12 Nuclear and Infranuclear Ocular Motor Disorders 209 12.2.3 Congenital Cranial Dysinnervation Syndrome Congenital cranial dysinnervation syndrome is a group of congenital neuromus- cular disorders caused by developmental errors in innervation. These disorders arepresent at birth and are usually nonprogressive. They have an autosomal inheri-tance pattern, but may occur sporadically . They may result from failed or misguideddevelopment of neurons (i.e., primary dysinnervation), or they may result fromaberrant innervation during development (i.e., secondary dysinnervation).

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"In acquired palsy , synkinesis usually ap-pears about nine weeks after injury , but it can be delayed until three to six monthsafterward; in congenital palsy , it appears about one to six months after birth. As a general rule, synkinesis does not occur after ischemic injury . Thus, in a patient who has a presumed ischemic palsy , the development of synkinesis requires furtherinvestigation to rule out other causes, such as compression or inﬂammation. 212 Part IV Ocular Motor and Neuromuscular Tranasmission Disorders, and Extraocular Muscle MyopathiesEye Movement Abnormalities in Oculomotor Nerve Synkinesis Pseudo-Graefe sign: retraction and elevation of the eyelid on attempted downgaze (mis- direction of ﬁbers for inferior rectus to levator palpebrae) Horizontal gaze-eyelid synkinesis: elevation of eyelid on attempted adduction (misdirec- tion of ﬁbers for medial rectus to levator palpebrae) Adduction on attempted elevation or depression (misdirection of ﬁbers for superior or in- ferior rectus to medial rectus) Limited vertical movement with occasional retraction of the globe on attempted vertical movement (due to simultaneous contraction of elevators and depressors) Pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupil: light-near dissociation of the pupil.

It lies at the dorsal margin of the medial longitudinal fasciculus."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"The trochlear nerve fascicle The fascicle crosses the midline at the anterior medullary velum (anterior ﬂoor ofthe fourth ventricle) before exiting the brainstem; thus, the right fourth nerve fasci-cle becomes the left fourth nerve, which innervates the left superior oblique muscle. The trochlear nerve is the only cranial nerve that exits from the dorsal surface of the brainstem, and it has the longest intracranial course (75 mm). The subarachnoid space The nerve curves around the lateral surface of the upper pons, passing between thesuperior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries to reach the prepontine cistern. Itthen runs forward on the free edge of the tentorium for 1–2 cm before penetratingthe dura of the tentorial attachment and entering the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus Within the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, the nerve lies below the oculomotornerve and above the ophthalmic division (V 1) of the trigeminal nerve. It then crosses over the oculomotor nerve and receives ﬁlaments from the carotid sympathetic plexus. The orbit The nerve enters the orbit through the superior orbital ﬁssure above the annulus ofZinn in company with the frontal and lacrimal branches of the ophthalmic divisionof the trigeminal nerve. It divides into several small fascicles that innervate the su-perior oblique muscle. 216 Part IV Ocular Motor and Neuromuscular Tranasmission Disorders, and Extraocular Muscle Myopathies Chapter 12 Nuclear and Infranuclear Ocular Motor Disorders 21712.3.1 Topographical Diagnosis of Acquired Trochlear Nerve Palsy Posterior cerebral artery Superior cerebellar arteryBasilar artery Petrous ridge Cavernous sinus Superior orbital fissureAqueduct Sella turcica Sphenoid ridgeAB C DFourth nerve nucleusInferior colliculus Lesions of the Trochlear Nucleus/Fascicle Because of the short course of the fascicle, distinguishing a nuclear from a fascicular le- sion is virtually impossible.

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"Contralateral (to the side of the palsy) Horner’s syndrome Horner’s syndrome is caused by damage to descending sympathetic ﬁbers from thehypothalamus in the dorsal brainstem (i.e., ﬁrst-order neurons). ■For example, a right-sided midbrain lesion causes damage to the right trochlear nu-cleus (resulting in a left fourth nerve palsy) and damage to descending sympatheticﬁbers (resulting in a right Horner’s syndrome). ■If the lesion affects the fascicle after it crosses the midline, then the Horner’s syn-drome is on the same side of the fourth nerve palsy . Ipsilateral (to the side of the palsy) relative afferent pupillary defect Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is caused by damage to pupillary lightﬁbers that leave the optic tract and travel via the brachium of the superior colliculusto synapse in the pretectal nucleus. ■For example, a right-sided midbrain lesion causes damage to the right trochlear nu-cleus (resulting in a left fourth nerve palsy) and damage to pupillary light ﬁbersoriginating from the right optic tract (resulting in a left RAPD) (see section 9.4.3). ■If the lesion affects the fascicle after it crosses the midline, then the RAPD is on theopposite side of the fourth nerve palsy .

Determine the side of hypertropia in primary position Example: If there is a right hypertropia (HT) in primary position, then the depres- sors of the right eye (inferior rectus [IR] and superior oblique [SO]) or the elevatorsof the left eye (superior rectus [SR] and inferior oblique [IO]) are weak (these mus-cles are outline in red in the ﬁgure above). 220 Part IV Ocular Motor and Neuromuscular Tranasmission Disorders, and Extraocular Muscle MyopathiesStep 2. Determine whether the hypertropia increases on right or left gaze ■The vertical rectus muscles (SR and IR) have their greatest vertical action when the eye is abducted. ■The oblique muscles (SO and IO) have their greatest vertical action when the eye isadducted."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"■Example: If a right HT increases on left gaze, then the oblique muscles of the righteye (SO and IO), or the vertical rectus muscles of the left eye (SR and IR) are in-volved (outlined in blue in the ﬁgure). Step 3. Determine whether the hypertropia increases on right or left head tilt  (Bielschowsky’s head tilt test) ■During right head tilt, the right eye incyclotorts (SO and SR), and left eye excyclo- torts (IO and IR). ■During left head tilt, the right eye excyclotorts (IO and IR), and left eye incyclotorts(SO and SR). ■Example: If a right HT increases on right head tilt, then the incyclotorters of theright eye (SO and SR) or the excyclotorters of the left eye (IO and IR) are involved(outlined in green in the ﬁgure). Because the right SO is outlined in all three steps,the diagnosis is right fourth nerve palsy . The three-step test is useful for the diagnosis of fourth nerve palsy; however, it is not reliable in diagnosing palsy of other cyclovertical muscles. Why does the hypertropiaincrease on right head tilt in right fourth nerve palsy (i.e., step 3)? ■During right head tilt, the otolith–ocular reﬂex (ocular counterroll) is activated,such that the right eye incyclotorts (SO and SR) and the left eye excyclotorts (IOand IR) ■The primary action of SO is incyclotorsion, and its secondary action is depression,whereas the primary action of SR is elevation, and its secondary action in incyclo-torsion. Thus, normally , during right head tilt, the net movement of the right eye isincyclotorsion with minimal vertical movement because the vertical action of SOand SR cancels each other out. ■In right fourth nerve palsy , the elevating action of SR is unopposed by the palsiedSO; thus, the hypertropia increases during right head tilt. Torsion Torsion is assessed subjectively using a double Maddox rod and assessed objectivelyusing ophthalmoscopy or photography . Characteristics of torsion are:"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"■Congenital palsy: often has very little or no measurable subjective torsion. ■Acquired palsy: usually has a measurable degree of torsion. ■Bilateral palsy: is often present with a complaint of torsional diplopia or measurableexcyclotorsion greater than 10°.

Sixth nerve palsy causes limitation of abduction and esotropia. Anatomy of the Sixth Nerve The abducens nucleus The abducens nucleus lies in the ﬂoor of the fourth ventricle, at the level of thelower pons, and contains three populations of neurons: 1. Abducens motoneurons, which innervate the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle 2. Abducens internuclear neurons, which project to the contralateral medial rectus subnucleus of the oculomotor nucleus via the medial longitudinal fasciculus. 3. Neurons that project to the cerebellar ﬂocculus. The genu of the facial nerve curves over the dorsal and lateral surface of the nucleus,"
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"while the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) lies medial to each nucleus. The abducens nerve fascicle During its passage in the pons, the fascicle is adjacent to the motor nucleus and fas-cicle of the facial nerve, the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the spinal tract ofthe trigeminal nerve, the superior olivary nucleus, the central tegmental tract, andthe corticospinal tract. The subarachnoid space The nerve emerges from the brainstem between the pons and the medulla, lateral tothe pyramidal prominence. It then runs upward along the ventral surface of thepons, lateral to the basilar artery , and passes between the pons and the anterior infe-rior cerebellar artery to ascend through the subarachnoid space along the clivus. Itthen pierces the dura mater, courses around or through the inferior petrosal sinus,and passes under the petroclinoid (Gruber’s) ligament in Dorello’s canal to enter thecavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus The nerve bends laterally around the intracavernous carotid artery and runs medialand parallel to the ophthalmic division (V 1) of the trigeminal nerve. The oculosym- pathetic ﬁbers leave the internal carotid artery and join brieﬂy with the abducensnerve before joining the ophthalmic division (V 1) of the trigeminal nerve. Unlike the oculomotor and trochlear nerves, the abducens nerve does not lie within the lateralwall of the sinus, but rather it runs within the body of the sinus. The orbit The nerve enters the orbit through the superior orbital ﬁssure, passes through theannulus of Zinn, and innervates the lateral rectus. 222 Part IV Ocular Motor and Neuromuscular Tranasmission Disorders, and Extraocular Muscle Myopathies Chapter 12 Nuclear and Infranuclear Ocular Motor Disorders 22312.4.1 Topographical Diagnosis of Acquired Abducens Nerve Palsy Medial longitudinal  fasciculus (MLF)Facial nerve fascicle Facial nerve nucleus  (motor)Abducens nucleus Abducens nerve fascicle Trigeminal tract and nucleus"

Ptosis ■Lid fatigue: Ptosis worsens on sustained upgaze. ■Enhancement of ptosis (the curtain sign): Manual elevation of one eyelid in bilateral ptosis leads to worsening of ptosis in the fellow eye (i.e., follows Hering’s law). ■Cogan’s lid-twitch sign: When the patient to looks down for about 15 sec and thenreﬁxates rapidly back to primary position, an upward overshoot of the lid occurs, fol- lowed by a slow droop or several twitches before the lid settles back to its ptotic position. ■Spontaneous eyelid retraction: Eyelid retraction usually occurs when the eye re-turns from upgaze to primary position due to post-tetanic facilitation of the levator palpebrae. External ophthalmoparesis ■Extraocular muscle involvement with no set pattern; pupils are not involved ■Variable measurement of phoria or tropia during the same or different examinations Orbicularis weakness: Sustained eyelid closure leads to fatigue of orbicularis and widening of palpebral ﬁssure (the “peek sign”or “peekaboo sign”).13.1 Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is the most common disorder affecting the neuromuscular junc- tion (incidence: 5 per 100,000). Ocular involvement accounts for initial complaintsin 75% of patients. Of patients presenting with ocular myasthenia, 50–80% eventu-ally develop generalized myasthenia, usually within two years of onset. 244 Part IV Ocular Motor and Neuromuscular Tranasmission Disorders, and Extraocular Muscle MyopathiesAxonal nerve terminal Vesicles with acetylcholine Acetylcholine Acetylcholine receptorsAcetylcholine receptor antibody"

Hypermetria of small saccades results from central adaptation which, in an attempt to overcome the weakness from myasthenia, increases the saccadic pulse such that small saccades become hypermetric 3. For large saccades, the eye starts off with normal velocity. Due to intra-saccadic fatigue, however, the pulse is unsustained causing the eye to slow down in mid-ﬂight, such that large saccades become hypometric.The eyethen reaches the target slowly by a step of innervation 4.The global ﬁbers (predominantly fast-twitch) of the agonist muscle start the saccade with a normal pulse, but then they rapidly fatigue, aborting the pulse and the eye stops.The orbital ﬁbers (predominantly tonic) alsofatigue during the saccade, aborting the step.Then the mechanical forces of the orbit rapidly pull the eye towardthe central position, causing a glissade.The combination of aborted saccade and oppositely directed glissadeconstitutes the quivering movement 5."
[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"A saccade may appear to be “hyperfast”because the pulse is originally programmed for a larger amplitude saccade which is aborted in mid-ﬂight due to fatigue 6.Tensilon injection unmasks the effects of central adaptation and exposes the increased saccadic innervation, resulting in saccade hypermetria and macrosaccadic oscillations Pathophysiology Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease caused by the presence of antibodiesagainst acetylcholine receptors, which leads to decreased number of available recep-tors (usually less than one-third that of normal). It is associated with other autoim-mune diseases, including thymoma, dysthyroidism, sarcoidosis, pernicious anemia,aplastic anemia, and collagen vascular diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, Sjögren’s syndrome). Workup Tensilon (edrophonium chloride) test ■Side effects: cholinergic (e.g., bradycardia, angina, bronchospasm) ■Steps for performing Tensilon test: 1.

The optimal age for thymectomy and the use of immunosuppression in the ju-venile form of the disease is controversial. 13.2.2 Neonatal Myasthenia Gravis Neonatal myasthenia gravis is a transient disorder that results from the passive transferof acetylcholine receptor antibodies from myasthenic mothers to their babies. It mayoccur anytime in the ﬁrst 72 h of life and abates spontaneously after 2–3 weeks as theantibodies are cleared, with no adverse sequelae after resolution. Symptoms include: ■Hypotonia, a feeble cry , feeding difﬁculty , facial paralysis, and mild respiratory distress ■Ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and orbicularis weakness in 15%. Treatment consists of administering cholinesterase inhibitors and supporting vital functions. 13.2.3 Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes Congenital myasthenic syndromes comprise a group of hereditary neuromusculartransmission disorders differentiated from neonatal myasthenia by the persistence ofsymptoms (neonatal myasthenia has a transient monophasic course). They are notautoimmune-related (i.e., absence of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies). TheTensilon test is usually negative because it relies on intact acetylcholinesterase andnormal channel opening time.

[Agnes_Wong]_Eye_Movement_Disorders,"1 Agenesis of Extraocular Muscles ■Most cases involve only a single muscle ■Often occurs in children with craniosynostoses 14.5.2 Anomalies of Extraocular Muscle Origin and Insertion Anomalies of extraocular muscle origin often occur in children with craniosynostoses. Brown’s syndrome (congenital form) 8 ■Deﬁcient elevation on adduction, improved elevation in the primary position, and normal or near-normal elevation on abduction ■Forced duction test shows mechanical restriction of upward and nasalward motion. Causes 1. Congenital form: due to congenitally short or inelastic tendon or to abnormal tendon-trochlear complex (which may account for spontaneous resolution in some cases) 2. Acquired form: iatrogenic, trauma, inﬂammatory or infectious processes (see sec- tion 14.4.2) Treatment 1. Superior oblique tendon tenotomy with inferior oblique recession (to prevent secondary superior oblique palsy) 2. Controlled weakening of the superior oblique using a silicone expander that is sewn between the cut ends of a tenotomized superior oblique tendon 14.5.3 Congenital Adherence of Extraocular Muscles ■Adhesion between the sheaths of the lateral rectus and inferior oblique muscles, causing deﬁcient abduction (usually bilateral) ■Adhesion between the sheaths of the superior rectus and superior oblique muscles,causing deﬁcient elevation 14.5.4 Congenital Myopathies Congential myopathies consist of a group of primarily nonprogressive myopathiesthat also affect the extraocular muscles, causing ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Thisgroup includes: 1. Myotubular myopathy (centronuclear myopathy) 2. Nemaline myopathy3. Central core myopathy4. Multicore disease Selected Bibliography 263Chapter 1 Burde RM.

DIPLOPIA_HISTORY_AND_EXAMINATION.10,"DIPLOPIA—HISTORY AND EXAMINATION Eric R. Eggenberger ABSTRACT Diplopia is rarely the favorite chief symptom for neurologists. Nonetheless, the underlying causes of diplopia often fall into the neurologist’s purview, and a systematic approach renders the diagnosis and management tenable. Like most of neurology, the history is critical, and the examination serves to confirm initial localization hypotheses. The neurologist needs to master specialized techniques to qualify and quantify ocular misalignment in order to appropriately diagnose and manage binocular diplopia.

The monocular/binocular char- acteristics and orientation of the ob- jects are fundamental to the history. Monocular diplopia is generally related to ocular causes (eg, refractive error, cataract) and is neither related to ocu- lar misalignment nor neurologic in ori- gin (Case 8-1 ). Binocular diplopia re- solves with closure of either eye and implies ocular misalignment (which is often neurologic in origin). The direc- tion of misalignment and presence or change with position of gaze provide clues to the diagnosis. Examples are shown in Table 8-1 . While we never say ‘‘never,’’ cortical diplopia is very rare with fewer than 100 reported cases. Cortical diplopia has several distinguishing features: The dip- lopia is present in each eye and iden- tical in character, ie, one or more du- plicated images oriented in the same direction. Typically an associated visual field defect is present, and the dupli- cated images are frequently in the area of missing visual field. Costly and un-necessary laboratory investigations and imaging can be avoided if these histor- ical features are not overlooked. Mono- cular diplopia is more typically related to ocular disease, often refractive, cor-"
DIPLOPIA_HISTORY_AND_EXAMINATION.10,"neal (eg, dry eye), or related to media opacity (eg, cataract). Monocular diplo- pia that does not resolve with pinhole and has no other ocular abnormalities on examination is a common functional symptom. Other historical and demographic factors, such as age, associated features (ptosis, pain, etc), precipitants of dip- lopia, diurnal variation, and past medi- cal history including vascular risk fac- tors, in addition to the examination, help determine anatomic localization and pathophysiology differential diag- nosis, which guides the evaluation. EXAMINATION Ocular alignment is the key compo- nent of the examination of patients with binocular diplopia ( Case 8-2 ). Misalign- ment refers to any deviation of the visual axis of one eye compared to the other. Ocular alignment can be mea- sured in several ways; the crudest 122 Continuum Lifelong Learning Neurol 2009;15(4)Case 8-1 A 45-year-old woman reported horizontal diplopia in all positions of gaze. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies and MRI brain scan were normal. Upon referral to neurology, a more detailed history was obtained and revealed that the images were often overlapped, with one image appearing as a ‘‘ghost’’ image. The patient was unaware whether the diplopia was monocular or binocular but had diplopia during the evaluation, affording the neurologist an opportunity to qualify charac- teristics of the diplopia. With left eye closure, diplopia persisted in the right eye, confirming the monocular nature of the symptom, thus effectively substantiating ocular localization. The neurologist next had the patient place a pinhole over the right eye, which resolved the diplopia. Further evaluation through the patient’s ophthalmologist suggested a dry eye component, and diplopia resolved with the use of artificial tears. Comment. The crucial part of the evaluation was differentiating monocular from binocular diplopia; isolated monocular diplopia that resolves with a pinhole is never neurologic.KEY POINT A Distinguishing monocular from binocular diplopia is critical in the evaluation of"

The light reflex normally falls in the same position on both corneas if the eyes are ortho-phoric, but if the eyes are misaligned, the light will be displaced from the center in one eye (the nonfixing eye). The light reflex will be centered inside the pupil of the fixing eye, while the amount of decentralization of the light 123 Continuum Lifelong Learning Neurol 2009;15(4)TABLE 8-1Clues to Diagnosis of Diplopia "" Binocular Horizontal Diplopia: Think Either Esodeviation or Exodeviation Worse at distance: esotropia; rule out cranial nerve VI palsy Worse at near: exotropia; rule out internuclear ophthalmoplegia or cranial nerve III palsy "" Binocular Oblique Diplopia Slight tilt of lower object implies torsion, and Worse with contralateral gaze and ipsilateral head tilt, and No ptosis or proptosis: cranial nerve IV palsy "" Binocular Diplopia With Variable Horizontal and Vertical Separation Dependent on Position of Gaze (Along With Ptosis and Mydriasis):"

A general neurologic examination was entirely normal, including full ductions each eye. Additional examination was then performed, including alternate cover testing. In primary position and right gaze, a small exodeviation was present, but in left gaze, a small esodeviation was found. Quantification of these deviations through use of the red Maddox rod demonstrated 2-prism diopters of exophoria in right gaze and primary position, converting to 5-prism diopters of esophoria in left gaze, suggestive of cranial nerve (CN) VI palsy in the left eye. An MRI brain scan revealed several T2-hyperintensities consistent with demyelination, raising the possibility of a clinically isolated demyelinating symptom. Comment. The treatment-altering differential diagnostic possibility of a clinically isolated demyelinating syndrome was only suggested by a more thorough examination of ocular alignment. When a patient reports binocular diplopia that is present during the examination, ocular misalignment is always present, but simple evaluation of the ductions (as neurologists often do by having the patient follow their finger left, right, up, and down) is often unrevealing. Localization of diplopia also allows more focused neuroimaging. Copyright @ American Academy of Neurology. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.

The Maddox rod, comprised of a series of cylinders that convert a light source into a red line, is a simple method to more accurately quantify ocular misalignment. The patient views a white light source (eg, transillumina- tor or penlight) with the left eye, while the Maddox rod is placed over the right eye. The patient sees a white light with the left eye, and a red line, ori- ented either vertically or horizontally (depending on the orientation of the Maddox rod cylinders), with the right eye. The patient is asked where the red line is while viewing the white light. If the patient sees the red line to the left of the light, then an exotropia exists (‘‘crossed,’’ ie, rod over right eye but perceived to the left; crossed = X, or eXotropia). An exodeviation appears from the patient’s perspective as illus- trated in Figure 8-2 .A ne s o t r o p i ai s present if the patient sees the line to the right of the light. The Maddox rod may also be ori- ented with the cylinders vertically to create a horizontal-appearing red line allowing measurement of vertical mis- alignment. If the light appears above the red line, then a right hypertropiaexists, while if the light is displaced below the line, it indicates a left hyper- tropia. The amount of deviation can be quantified by the use of a prism placed over the Maddox rod to shift the line so it bisects the light. The red glass test is another method to characterize ocular misalignment. A translucent red filter is placed over the right eye. The patient who is seeing double during the examination will now identify one red object and one white object. A penlight, light switch, or other easily seen object can be used as a fixation target. The patient can then identify a red light and white light side by side. By having the patient move the"
DIPLOPIA_HISTORY_AND_EXAMINATION.10,"head and quantify the distance be- tween the objects, a rough measure of comitance or incomitance can be obtained, ie, ‘‘the red and white lights are 1 inch apart on right gaze, 2 inches apart in primary gaze, and 4 inches apart on left gaze.’’ The same rules about crossed and uncrossed diplopia from the Maddox rod apply to the red glass. This method requires an alert, observant patient and is more difficult to quantify than other methods. The alternate cover test is more difficult to perform but is considered the criterion standard for alignment. With the patient fixing on a target (eg, a specific letter on the Snellen chart), the examiner alternately covers one eye, then the other, thus forcing the patient to fix with the uncovered eye. Any shift or eye movement noticed in the uncovered eye upon switching the cover indicates ocular misalignment (eg, if the covered right eye moves124FIGURE 8-2An exotropia is present if the patient sees the line to the right of the light.

This test is repeated in the nine cardinal positions of gaze to discern a pattern, which is critical to topical diagnosis. This method requires the patient to maintain fixation but does not require observations by the patient that are required by Maddox rod or red glass testing. The ocular motility examination also includes pursuit, saccades, ductions, and versions. Pursuit is tested when the patient follows an accommoda- tive target (a large letter on the near c a r d ,n o taf i n g e ro rp e na st h e s ea r e more diffuse nonaccommodative tar- gets) slowly in the horizontal and ver- tical gaze. Binocular movements in vari- ous directions are known as versions (eg, leftward version, rightward ver- sion), while ductions refer to the extent of monocular eye movements (eg, supraduction right eye, infraduc- tion left eye). Ductions can be mea- sured by millimeters of scleral show in a position of gaze ( Figure 8-3 ). Saccades are rapid eye movements that shift fixation quickly from one target to another and are important to check because these movements can reveal ocular abnormalities (such as a subtle internuclear ophthalmople-gia [INO]) not present during pursuit, and some diseases preferentially affect saccades. Note should be made of any abnor- mal head position. Patients with diplo- pia will often turn to avoid the position of diplopia or action of a paretic nerve or muscle (eg, patients with abducens nerve palsy turn the head toward the side of the palsy, thus placing the eyes in contraversion, while patients with trochlear nerve palsy assume a con- tralateral head tilt and chin-down posi- tion to avoid gaze into the diplopic field). Occasionally, the head tilt from a trochlear palsy can mimic torticollis in a child. Ptosis is best measured by the pal- pebral fissure distance. This can be measured in two ways. Measuring from the upper eyelid to the lower eyelid"
DIPLOPIA_HISTORY_AND_EXAMINATION.10,"gives the palpebral fissure height (in millimeters). Alternatively, marginal re- flex distance 1 (MRD 1) refers to the distance from the corneal reflex from a light the patient fixes to the upper eyelid, while MRD 2 refers to the dis- tance from the corneal light reflex to the lower eyelid margin. Using MRD 1 allows measurement of upper eye- lid position only, eliminating any effect from an abnormal lower eyelid posi- tion. Lagophthalmos or lower eyelid laxity can increase the palpebral fissure distance masking upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 8-4 ). The clinician should also be aware of signs, such as proptosis or eyelid re- traction, suggesting orbital disease. Prop- tosis can be measured with a simple125 Continuum Lifelong Learning Neurol 2009;15(4)FIGURE 8-4Pupil assessment includes size in light, size in dark, and reactivity.

LOCALIZATION"
DIPLOPIA_HISTORY_AND_EXAMINATION.10,"Binocular diplopia generally indicates ocular misalignment, and the clinical evaluation should first be directed at localization. The potential anatomic locations for binocular diplopia include the following: oSupranuclear (skew deviation) oOcular motor nerve nuclei oInfranuclear segment (CN III, CN IV, or CN VI) oInternuclear segment (medial longitudinal fasciculus; INO) oNeuromuscular junction (myasthenia gravis [MG]) oMuscle (trauma, thyroid eye disease, neoplasm) Begin narrowing the anatomic dif- ferential diagnosis by considering the most specific patterns of ocular mis- alignment first; these are related to ocular motor nerves and nuclei, and internuclear lesions (ie, CN III, CN IV, or CN VI palsies and INO). If the pat- tern of misalignment and motility does not fit any of these, they can be dis- missed; but if the pattern fits that of anocular motor nerve, nucleus, or INO, then begin with this working hypoth- esis while not discarding the potential mimics, such as MG. MG may masquer- ade as any pupil-sparing pattern of mis- alignment and needs to remain in the differential diagnosis (especially if pto- sis is present) unless pupil involvement, proptosis (keeping in mind the possi- bility of MG associated with thyroid dis- ease), significant pain, or aberrant re- generation exists. In misalignment that does not conform to a specific pattern, consider neuromuscular junction dis- ease, myopathy, or multiple CN palsies (eg, Miller-Fisher syndrome, Wernicke encephalopathy, polyneuropathy related to cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure, or meningeal disease). In such cases, it is often helpful to consider each eye separately in arriving at a differential diagnosis. Skew deviation is supranu- clear dysfunction and presents with vertical misalignment that does not fit a muscle or CN pattern (binocular verti- cal or oblique diplopia). Because skew is supranuclear (thought to be related to otolith fiber derangement), ductions"
DIPLOPIA_HISTORY_AND_EXAMINATION.10,"in each eye are full/normal (in contrast to impaired ductions that can be seen in CN III palsy). Skew deviation may cause varying patterns of hypertropia, but commonly encountered situations include a comitant hypertropia (eg, 5-prism diopters right hypertropia in all positions of gaze) or alternating hypertropias (eg, right hypertropia on right gaze and left hypertropia on left gaze). Skew deviation localizes to the brainstem and cerebellum nonspecifi- cally (accompanying signs assist more accurate localization). The classic pattern for a right CN IV palsy is right hypertropia (RHT), RHT worse in left gaze, and RHT worse in right head tilt. In addition to the hypertropia, CN IV palsy causes excyclotorsion of the in- volved eye, so one image often has a tilt, and the horizontal line appears diplopic126FIGURE 8-5Exophthalmos can be quantified even without a Hertel exophthalmometer by using a simple ruler to measure from the lateral canthus to the anterior extent of the cornea in each eye.

Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"Approach to Diplopia By Christopher C. Glisson, DO, MS, FAAN ABSTRACT P U R P O S EO FR E V I E W : “Double vision ”is a commonly encountered concern in neurologic practice; the experience of diplopia is always sudden and is frequently a cause of great apprehension a nd potential disability for patients. Moreover, while some causes of diplopia are benign, others require immediate recognition, a focused diagnostic evaluation, and appropriate treatment to prevent vision- and life-threatening outcomes. A logical, easy-to-follow approach to the clinical evaluation of patients with diplopia is helpful in ensuring accurate localization, a comprehensive differential diagnosis, and optimal patient care. This article provides a foundation for formulating an approach to the patient with diplopia and includes practical examples of developing the differential diagnosis, effectively using confirmatory examination techniques, determining an appropriatediagnostic strategy, and (where applicable) providing effective treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent population-based analyses have determined that diplopia is a common presentation in both ambulatory and emergency department settings, with 850,000 such visits occurring annually. For patients presenting to an outpatient facility, diagnoses are rarely serious. However, potentially life-threatening causes (predominantly stroke ortransient ischemic attack) can be encountered. In patients presenting with diplopia related to isolated cranial nerve palsy, immediate neuroimaging can often be avoided if an appropriate history and examination are used to exclude worrisome etiologies. SUMMARY: Binocular diplopia is most often due to a neurologic cause. The onset of true “double vision ”is debilitating for most patients and commonly prompts immediate access to health care services as a consequence of functional impairment and concern for worrisome underlying causes. Although patients may seek initial evaluation through the emergency department or from their primary care/ophthalmic provider, elimination of an ocular cause will not infrequently result in the patient being referred for neurologic consultation. A logical, localization- driven, and evidence-based approach is the most effective way to arrive at the correct diagnosis and provide the best outcome for the patient.

The majority of this article is dedicated to neurologic causes of diplopia with an emphasis on understanding the relevant neuroanatomy s ubserving ocular motility and providing a framework for interpreting ocular misal ignment seen at examination. Armed with this information, the localization of diplo pia (to relevant structures of the central nervous system, cranial nerves, neuromus cular junction, extraocular muscles, or"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"orbit) is relatively straightforward and can allow the clinician to develop a viable differential diagnosis, a prudent diagnostic evaluation, and, in some cases, an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate symptoms. MONOCULAR DIPLOPIA Monocular diplopia is defined as the perception of double (or multiple) images when viewing with only one eye. Except in very rare circumstances of bilateral monocular diplopia (eg, cerebral diplopia, polyopia, and palinopsia as manifestations of disease involving the primary or secondary visual cortices1,2), the perception of a “shadow, ”“ghost, ”“haze, ”or even an overt “double image ”that persists with the nonviewing eye closed is strongly supportive of an ocular cause. Common causes for this include refractive error (uncorrected or outdated correction), corneal defects (including d ry eye), cataract, or macular disease. This can be easily confirmed by placing a pinhole occluder (or similar apparatus) over the viewing eye and asking the patient if this improves or resolves the double vision.3If so, the patient should be reassured that he or she does not harbor neurologic pathology and should be referred to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for further evaluation. While not strictly monocular, it is also helpful for the clinician to be aware of physiologic diplopia, which is a normal perception that can be precipitated by misalignment of the ocular axes when viewing a specific object. For example, focusing on a hand held close to the face will cause objects in the background to appear “double. ”Likewise, focusing on a distant target and holding an object up close within the field of view will cause a similar phenomenon (ie, “floating finger ”or“frankfurter illusion ”).4Concerned patients presenting for evaluation after discovering this phenomenon can be reassured that it is completely natural, and no further investigations are required. APPROACH TO BINOCULAR DIPLOPIA Binocular diplopia occurs as a result of misalignment of the eyes/visual axes and, as such, must be regarded as neurologic in etiology. Proper clinical evaluation of binocular diplopia begins with a detailed history with an emphasis on any prior"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"episodes of diplopia, a history of strabismus or “lazy eye ”during childhood, and whether the patient has had recent or remote head trauma ( CASE 8-1). Perhaps most important is eliciting a detailed description of the patient ’s perception of the diplopia, including whether the diplopia is constant or intermittent (andany relevant patterns thereof), what the orientation of the diplopia is (that is, whether the relationship between two images is horizontal, vertical, or oblique/diagonal), whether the diplopia is more noticeable at distance or near, and whether the diplopia becomes more (or less) prominent in different directions of gaze. In many cases, accurate localization of the diplopia can be identified by a careful history alone. One recent study found that an effective history and thorough examination accurately identified the cause for the diplopia in the majority (70.5%) of cases, and only a relatively small number (4.7%)KEY POINTS ●A detailed history and systematic examination can often accurately localize the cause of diplopia. ●Monocular diplopia is rarely due to neurologic pathology. ●Eliciting the orientation of the double image (horizontal, vertical, or oblique), whether diplopia is present at distance or near,and whether the diplopia worsens in any direction of gaze are fundamental to accurate localization.

Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"(representing 95% of the population analy zed), diagnoses were rarely serious, but potentially life-threatening causes (pr edominantly stroke or transient ischemic attack) were present in 16% of diplopia- related emergency department visits.6Such studies highlight the value of an effective s trategy for obtaining a relevant history and examination and the utility of using these to guide management. Intermittent Versus Constant Diplopia Diplopia that is intermittent tends to either be situation dependent (ie, onlynoticeable with certain tasks or in specific environments) or worsen with fatigue. The former may suggest a tendency toward ocular misalignment or exacerbating CASE 8-1 A 64-year-old man presented for evaluation of “double vision ”that he had been experiencing for 1 month. He initially noted the double vision while reading his morning newspaper, but over time he became aware of a similar visual disturbance when attempting to descend stairs in his local shopping center. A detailed history revealed that he did not notice diplopia with other activities. The double image was obliqu ely oriented and binocular. He stated, “Ic l o s eo n ee y ew h e nIw a n tt or e a d ,a n di tg o e sa w a y . ”The patient did not have eye pain, ptosis, dysphagia, dyspnea, or other neurologic symptoms. During the interview, the patient relayed that he had been involved in a motor vehicle accident in his thirties, in which he had been “knocked out for a few minutes ”but had no other immediate sequelae. The ocular motility examination revealed a left hypertropia that became more pronounced in right gaze. The patient endorsed diplopia when looking down; when asked to view the junction between the wall and the floor, he reported “seeing two lines, one straight and one diagonal, ”which, if extended, would intersect to the left. The patient had a head tilt to the right, and review of requested family photographs confirmed that this had been present for many years. The description of the patient ’s symptoms, in association with the ocular motility examination and the presence of a long-standing head tilt, was consistent with a posttraumatic left cranial nerve IV palsy with"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"age-related decompensation. COMMENT This case exemplifies the utility of eliciting certain characteristics of thediplopia (eg, orientation, presence/absence in specific directions of gaze and with specific activities) in determining a potential localization. It can also be helpful to ascertain whether remote head trauma has occurred and to be attentive to correlating features of a long-standing etiology (such as a head tilt that can be confirmed by photographs). In many cases, patients are able to compensate for ocular misalignment to the extent that they do not notice diplopia for several years until such time as their unrecognized adaptive strategies become decompensated.APPROACH TO DIPLOPIA 1364 OCTOBER 2019 Copyright © American Academy of Neurology.

Diplopia that worsens with fatigue immediately raises suspicion for myasthenia gravis (MG) (refer to the section on MG), but it is important to recognize that many other forms of diplopia, such as decompensation of a long-standing strabismus, may also follow this pattern. Orientation of Images Binocular diplopia that is horizontal in orientation suggests involvement of the medial or lateral rectus muscle. Diplopia that is vertical and torsional (with the lower image tilted) suggests involvement of the superior oblique muscle (particularly if associated with a compensatory head tilt to the side opposite the weak muscle), while pure vertical diplopia is more likely to reflect brainstem or cerebellar pathology (manifesting as an acquired vertical misalignment of theeyes, referred to as skew deviation )."
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"Diplopia that is oblique/diagonal, reflecting dysfunction of both vertical and horizontal muscles, suggests dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (involving some combination of the inferior rectus, superior rectus, and inferior oblique muscl es). Further localizin g information can be obtained by asking the patient whether the diplopia is worse in a specific direction of gaze (eg, diplopia that is most pronounced at distance and on gaze to the left is supportive of dysfunction of the left lat eral rectus muscle/cranial nerve VI). Additional localizing information can be ascertained by determining if the diplopia is more pronounced at distance or at near. Difficulty with reading or other near tasks suggests dysfunction of convergence, reflecting possible involvement of cranial nerve III or medial rectus muscle or convergenceinsufficiency. Conversely, if the patient notices diplopia when viewing at distance, dysfunction of divergence should be suspected, prompting further investigation for involvement of the lateral rectus muscle or cranial nerve VI. Associated Features Diplopia is always sudden in onset (the perception of double vision is a present or absent phenomenon), although very mild diplopia may be perceived as “blurriness ” to some patients; patients and medical personnel often ascribe undue importance tothe onset of diplopia as it relates to the pote ntial for a severe underlying cause, and it is appropriate to provide reassurance in t his regard. However, consideration of the duration of diplopia (in association with the other historical elements discussed above) can be useful in the elucidation of a differential diagnosis. Additionally, it should be determined whether the patient ’s diplopia is associated with headache, pain with (attempted) eye movement, ptos is, dysphagia, dyspnea, weakness, or, in patients older than 55 years of age, scalp tenderness, jaw/tongue claudication, fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or b ody pain to suggest giant cell arteritis. Diplopia/ocular misalignment that doe s not change with direction of gaze is classified as comitant and suggests a cong enital strabismus (or skew deviation if"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"vertical); diplopia that varies depending on the direction of gaze is termed incomitant (and most often indicates extraocular muscle dysfunction). Ascertainment of the above historical information is of vital importance. Following this, a schema to discover whether the causative ocular misalignment is due to pathology affecting candidate structures including the brainstem nuclei, cranial nerves, neuromuscular junction, extraocular muscles, or orbital tissues can be employed ( FIGURE 8-17) based on supportive findings at the neurologic examination.KEY POINTS ●Diplopia that occurs with fatigue does not necessarily imply myasthenia gravis; long-standing and decompensated ocular misalignment can also become symptomatic when patients are tired or under stress or in the setting of concomitant illness. ●Diplopia/ocular misalignment that does not change with the direction of gaze is classified as comitant; diplopia that varies depending on the direction of gaze is termed incomitant and most often indicates extraocular muscle dysfunction.

Additionally, evaluation of eye movements is not perceived as threatening (even to the most apprehensive patient), and aspects of clinically relevant dysfunction can beascertained even in patients who are unable to fully participate. Key components of the ocular motility examination include fixation/gaze holding, monocular"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"eye movements (ductions), and assessment of binocular eye movements (versions, pursuits, and saccades). Initially, fixation should be evaluated by asking the patient to view a target of visual interest (the large letter on an eye chart at distance or the“95”at the top of a near card) in primary viewing position. Careful attention should be paid to any instability of fixation, which may include square-wave jerks (spontaneous, small-amplitude horizontal saccades away from fixation followed promptly by a corrective saccade in the opposite direction [note that square-wave jerks occurring fewer than 9 times per minute can be normal in most individuals]) or nystagmus, which may suggest pathology affecting ocular coordination ( VIDEO 8- 1). Next, evaluation of ductions is completed by occluding one eye and asking the patient to follow a visual target through all cardinal gaze positions (VIDEO 8- 2). Assessment should be made of any apparent limitation or restriction of eye movements; additionally, the pursuit movements (ie, tracking) should be smooth and uninterrupted. Examination of fixation is commonly overlooked during the ocular motility examination but is essential in identifying potential pathologic features that may be associated with diplopia. Subtle asymmetry in ocular alignment is sometimes easer to discern with testing of versions, in which the same process is repeated but with both eyes viewing (thereby allowing for comparison of symmetry between the two eyessimultaneously) ( VIDEO 8- 3). Finally, testing of saccades involves asking the patient to rapidly and alternately fixate on two different targets (eg, a finger held eccentrically and the examiner ’s nose in primary gaze). This should be performed in both the horizontal and vertical planes ( VIDEO 8- 4). In addition to noting any apparent ocular misalignment, consideration should be given to any delay in initiation, the velocity of the saccades, and any inaccuracy (ocular dysmetria) as a potential indicator of brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction that may accompany the diplopia.

In all nontraumatic cases, MRI (with dedicated skull base and orbital imaging) is preferable to CT. When cranial nerve dysfunction is suspected, care should be taken to directly reviewthe images and “follow the course ”of the involved cranial nerve from its origin to identify structural pathology. If other signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure are present, it is also important to visualize the brain parenchyma to exclude space-occupying lesions. In general, neuroimaging has a low diagnostic yield in isolated fourth, pupil-sparing third, and sixth nerve palsies in older patients with vascular risk factors. However, in one study, 10% of patients older than 50 years of age with one vascular risk factor were found to have other causes, including neoplasm, infarction, and giant cell arteritis. 8Other disease-specific considerations related to the diagnostic evaluation are included below. CAUSES OF BINOCULAR DIPLOPIA A thorough evaluation of ocular motility allows the examiner to consider the various potential causes of ocular misalignment, which can be broadly localized to supranuclear, internuclear, infranuclear, neuromuscular junction, extraocular muscle, or orbital dysfunction. A systematic and stepwise approach to"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"considering the relative likelihood of each of these neuroanatomic locations is helpful in the clinical setting. Dysfunction of Supranuclear and Internuclear Ocular Motor Control It is important to remember that the intracranial apparatus responsible for directing and coordinating ocular motility (and thereby ensuring single vision) is complex. Therefore, while more distal pathologies that cause diplopia (eg, isolated cranial nerve palsies, disorders of the neuromuscular junction, and orbital restrictive processes) can be straightforward, more proximal lesions may be difficult for the practicing neurologist to precisely localize in the setting of a single examination. Lesions affecting the cortical connections to the nuclei of II,IV, and VI are termed supranuclear ; lesions affecting the connections between nuclei are internuclear ; and those affecting the nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscles are infranuclear . Broadly considered, dysfunction of the cerebral hemispheres (precipitated by metabolic disorders or medications); neu rodegenerative diseases that compromise the basal ganglia (such as the parkinsonian syndromes and Huntington disease); or structural injury to the pons, midbrain, or cerebellum are all potential causes of (or contributors to) diplopia. Each of these, however, will be accompanied by other neurologic signs and symptoms, often more prominentthan the diplopia itself, that will provide helpful diagnostic information. However, important considerations within this category that may present with isolated diplopia include skew deviation and internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). Skew deviation results in vertical ocular misalignment/diplopia that typically results from injury to the utricular-vestibular-ocular pathway (brainstem or cerebellum) governing vertical and torsional eye position in response to body tilt.

He reported that when watching her serve the ball from the right side of the court to the left, he would see “two tennis balls for a second, and then things went back to normal. ”He did not report any other occasions of double vision, nor did he endorse eye pain, ptosis, or other neurologic symptoms. Testing of saccades confirmed a right internuclear ophthalmoplegia with otherwise normal ocular motility and alignment. Given the patient ’s age and otherwise unremarkable examination, brain MRI was required to evaluate for a demyelinating lesion involving the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). Given the patient ’s report that the symptom manifested later in the day, ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) was also considered. (Patients with MG may develop dyscoordinated eye movements that"

MRI of the brain disclosed an enhancing lesion involving the right MLF, in addition to other characteristic lesions of multiple sclerosis within the brain parenchyma. He was treated with a 3-day course of IV steroids, and the ocular motility disturbance resolved within 6 weeks. COMMENT This case highlights a common description of patients with internuclearophthalmoplegia, a transient perception of two images that “have to catch up with each other. ”Although this cause of diplopia may be associated with failure of adduction on smooth pursuit testing, in certain cases pursuit appears normal, and saccadic testing is needed to make the diagnosis (showing a delay in adduction). Given that the predominant feature of myasthenia gravis is worsening with fatigue, patients who are symptomatic later in the day or when tired should be evaluated for neuromuscular junction disease.

Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"characterized by brief, specific exacerbations; patients often describe a sense of “one eye catching up to the other ”with horizontal saccades. Key examination findings are slowed adduction in one eye with corresponding abducting nystagmus in the other eye (these findings are most often best ascertained bytesting saccades, as discussed above). INO can sometimes be mistaken for third nerve palsy, but the ocular motility examination can exclude this based on absent involvement of other muscles innervated by the third nerve (superior rectus, inferior rectus, and levator among them). Therefore, a key examination feature that helps distinguish INO from medial rectus muscle weakness or a partial third nerve palsy is that adduction with convergence is preserved. INO results from the dysfunction of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which connects the ipsilateral sixth nerve nucleus in the pons to the contralateral third nerve nucleus (medial rectus subnucleus) in the midbrain. Although several possible causes exist, the most frequently encountered are demyelination (in patients younger than 50 years of age) and brainstem stroke (in patients older than 50 years ofage). Because of the potential causes of both skew deviation and INO, neuroimaging (preferably brain MRI) is indicated for patients presenting with these findings. It is also important to remember that INO may be bilateral; these lesions often occur in the midbrain and affect the convergence nucleus, resulting in a large-angle exotropia (meaning the eyes are deviated outward) and convergence insufficiency (the so-called wall-eyed bilateral INO) ( CASE 8-2). Dysfunction of Nuclear and Infranuclear Ocular Motor Control The oculomotor (third), trochlear (fourth), and abducens (sixth) cranial nerves are the final mediators of the complex mechanism of ocular motility that originates in the brainstem, with modulation from the frontal eye fields, cerebellum, and other structures within the brain. Failure of these nerves to orient the globes in a coordinated fashion, even to a mild degree, will result in the"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"perception of double vision (or, if subtler, ”blurred vision ”that resolves when the patient occludes either eye). Principal actions of these cranial nerves are reviewed in TABLE 8-1, but as a practical matter, it is helpful to remember that cranial nerve VI (innervating the lateral rectus muscle) abducts the eye, cranial nerve IV (innervating the superior oblique muscle) depresses and intorts the eye for actions such as reading and negotiating curbs/going down stairs or escalators/addressing golf balls, and cranial nerve III does “everything else. ” A thorough understanding of the patterns and causes of diplopia related to cranial nerve dysfunction is of vital importance to the clinician when it comes to evaluating diplopia. As evidence of this, a study by O ’Colmain and colleagues5 found that of 149 patients presenting with diplopia of fewer than 4-weeks duration, more than 50% had an isolated third, fourth, or sixth cranial nervepalsy; the remainder of the patients were determined to have a mechanical cause (10.7%), a dysfunction of higher cortical control (10.1%), decompensation of a preexisting ocular misalignment (8.1%), an idiopathic cause (6.7%), or a monocular cause (5.4%). Adding to the localizing information that can be gleaned from dysfunction of the third nerve is the possibility of levator involvement (resulting in ptosis) or involvement of the pupil (resulting in anisocoria due to mydriasis of the involved eye) caused by disruption of the central caudal nucleus (a midline, unpaired structure, one of the third nerve nuclei responsible for innervation of the bilateralKEY POINT ●Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is best identified by testing saccades.

When the palsy results from injury to the third nerve nucleus on one side, the patient may present with ptosis and supraduction weakness in the eye contralateral to the more complete third nerve palsy because of bilateral innervation by the central caudal nucleus and decussation of fibers from thesuperior rectus nucleus. If, instead, the fascicles of the third nerve are affected as they course through the midbrain, patients may present with diplopia that is accompanied by ataxia, tremor, or hemiparesis. The discovery of a new pupil-involving third nerve palsy should prompt a search for a compressive CASE 8-3 A 64-year-old man presented for evaluation of binocular horizontaldiplopia that began 2 weeks earlier and was most bothersome when viewing at a distance and when driving. He noted that the diplopia wasmore prominent when he directed his gaze to the left but otherwise it was present “all the time. ”He had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. On examination, the patient ’s left eye did not fully abduct, but all other movements were intact. Alternate cover testing identified an esodeviation (or“in-turning ”of the eyes) that was minimal in right gaze but increased in left gaze. The fundus examination was normal, without optic disc edema. Given the patient ’s history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, his presentation was con sistent with microvascular cranial nerve VI palsy.

A restrictive process within the orbit (causing restriction of the medial rectus muscle) was also a possi bility, but the absence of abnormal eyelid findings, pain with eye movements, or proptosis made this less likely. Although the patient was older than 55 years of age, giant cell arteritis was not supported due to the paucity of systemic symptoms. Appropriate modification of cerebrovascular risk factors was recommended. The patient returned for follow- u p8w e e k sl a t e r ,a tw h i c ht i m eh e volunteered that the “double vision is gone, except when I look all the way to the left. ”Ocular motility had improved, and the reduced abduction of the left eye was virtually resolved. Neuro-ophthalmic follow-up continued for another month, at which time the ocular motility examination was normal and diplopia had fully resolved. COMMENT This case highlights the importance of determining the pattern of the ocular misalignment. Binocular horizontal diplopia that is worse at distanceand in left gaze is consistent with impairment of divergence and suggests involvement of the left lateral rectus muscle/cranial nerve VI. Given the potential for increased intracranial pressure to present with a sixth nerve palsy as a false localizing sign, a fundus examination should be performed to evaluate for papilledema, and consideration should be given to neuroimaging to exclude a space-occupying lesion.APPROACH TO DIPLOPIA 1370 OCTOBER 2019 Copyright © American Academy of Neurology.

In patients older than 50 years of age, third nerve palsies that spare the pupil but are otherwise complete are frequently the result of ischemia, and patients tend to recover in approximately 3 months. Isolated fourth nerve palsies are frequently the result of trauma but also may reflect decompensation of a congenital dysgenesis of the nerve or superior oblique muscle. Isolated sixth cranial nerve palsies ( CASE 8-3) may be falsely localizing given that the protracted course of the nerve from the pontomedullary junction, along the clivus, then piercing the dura at the Dorello canal, over the petrous ridge, and finally into the cavernous sinus, makes it especially susceptible to disruption via stretching of the nerve caused by increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, patients presenting with diplopia due to cranial nerve VI palsy should be carefully evaluated for papilledema or other features suggestive of intracranial structural pathology. Dysfunction of the Neuromuscular Junction MG is an autoimmune disease in which circulating antibodies block the effective communication between the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and its receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. While generalized forms of the disease exist and patients with ocular MG may progress to generalized MG,10intermittent diplopia and ptosis remain the predominant presenting symptoms. A long-regarded clinical rule of t humb is that ocular MG can mimic any pupil-sparing cause of diplopia, and thus this should be considered within the differential for most patients presenting with isolated diplopia. The primary historical feature that should prompt consideration of MG, however, is the intermittency of the double vision and its tendency to occur with fatigue and resolve with rest. This can be easily demonstrated during the exam ination by noting any abnormalities in ocular motility and by careful measurement of ocular misalignment, then repeating the same portions of the examination after asking the patient to rest (or sleep) with his or her eyes closed for 30 minutes or following the application of ice to the closed eyes for 2 minutes (the ice pack test).11,12Improvement in the examination under"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"these conditions is highly suggestive of MG; recrudescence of the findings over a short period of time thereafter is also supportive. Additionally, patients and their family members should be queried about potential associated symptoms such as ptosis (which is also commonly variable and more prominent with fatigue), dysphagia, dyspnea, or other symptoms of generalized neuromuscular junction dysfunction. In addition to the symptoms improving with rest and worsening with fatigue, which can be demonstrated during the examination, additional ocular findings can assist with clinical confirmation. These findings include eyelid curtaining (lifting of one eyelid bythe practitioner causes the fellow eyelid to droop), the Cogan eyelid twitch sign (in which the upper eyelid jerks up once or twice upon return to primary gaze from downgaze, especially if following a prolonged period of upgaze), 13and weakness of the orbicularis muscles with forced or prolonged eye closure. Serum testing for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies can be helpful in confirming autoimmune MG but is positive in only 50% to 70% of patients with purely ocular disease.14Approximately half of patients with clinical features of MG but who are negative for the AChR antibody may harbor antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK).15These patients are likely to have aKEY POINTS ●Patients presenting with cranial nerve VI palsy should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, which includes fundus examination. ●Myasthenia gravis can mimic any pupil-sparing ocular motility deficit.

In patients with pure ocular MG, single-fiber EMG of the orbicularis oculi is more sensitive than repetitive nerve stimulation.20Treatment for ocular MG is varied and principally relies on inhibition of the metabolism of acetylcholine (pyridostigmine) or modulation of the immune system (steroids or other immunomodulatory therapies). Orbital Disease Various pathologic processes within the orbit can impair the normal contraction of the extraocular musculature or mechanically restrict the movement of the globe. Thyroid ophthalmopathy (also referred to as thyroid eye disease or Graves ophthalmopathy) is an autoimmune disease that causes progressive edematous changes of the orbital musculature resulting in restriction of eye movements. The inferior rectus muscles are most commonly involved, followed by medial andsuperior rectus muscles 21; diplopia is most commonly vertical as the lateral rectus muscles are less likely to be involved. Because of progressive enlargement of the extraocular muscles, proptosis and periorbital edema, which tends to be more pronounced on awakening and improves during the course of the day, are associated features. Most important, progressive muscle enlargement may cause"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"compression of the optic nerve at the orbital apex; for this reason, formal visual field studies are required to monitor for insidious visual field constriction. Diagnosis can be confirmed by imaging (CT or MRI) of the orbits documenting characteristic edema and hypertrophy of the extraocular muscles; laboratory studies for thyroid dysfunction may or may not be abnormal, but measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies can correlate withdisease severity and help monitor for response to treatment. 22In the absence of severe symptoms or impending visual decline, most patients can be managed conservatively with a focus on treating underlying thyroid dysfunction (if present), mitigating corneal exposure related to proptosis, and discontinuation of smoking. Moderate disease can be treated with immunomodulation (typically oral prednisone); severe disease may require surgery for orbital decompression. More recently, an insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) inhibitor (teprotumumab) has been shown to improve proptosis and produce rapid symptomatic improvement as compared to placebo.23 Idiopathic orbital myositis, also known as idiopathic orbital inflammation, is a rare inflammatory disorder resulting in painful, isolated extraocular muscle dysfunction most commonly in the distri bution of the third cranial nerve. It is more likely to occur in women and in the third decade of life.24Horizontal diplopia with the presence of pain is central to the d iagnosis; proptosis, periocular edema, and conjunctival hyperemia may also be present. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI of the orbits documenting unilateral thickening and enhancement of the involved muscle and its myotendinous insertion.25Similar orbital inflammation can be seen in IgG4-related disease, an immune-mediated fibro-inflammatoryAPPROACH TO DIPLOPIA 1372 OCTOBER 2019 Copyright © American Academy of Neurology.

Orbital lymphoma may appear similar to idiopathic orbital inflammation and should be considered in progressive or recurrent cases, especially in older patients. For patients with idiopathic orbital myositis –associated diplopia, syste mic corticosteroids with a protracted taper is the principal form of t reatment; a more thoughtful algorithm for management of this disorder has been proposed.26 TREATMENT APPROACH Ideally, resolution of the underlying cause of the diplopia is achieved. However, depending on the etiology, this may require time for the therapeutic intervention to take effect. In other circumstances, such as with patients harboring a decompensated strabismus or stroke, the diplopia may remain. Generally speaking, long-standing or residual diplopia can always be resolved. Careful consideration should be given to which therapeutic strategy is most satisfactory, will provide the greatest return to the desired functional status,and is consistent with the patient ’s concomitant conditions and long-term goals. Monocular Occlusion For patients with binocular diplopia, the most straightforward approach is covering one eye. Many patients will recognize this independently and may unconsciously close one eye to improve their visual experience. On a longer-term basis, this can be achieved through the use of an eye patch, although somepatients may eschew this given the cosmetic implications. Moreover, it is crucial to instruct patients using an eye patch to ensure that the eyelid under the patch is fully closed to minimize the potential for corneal injury. For similar reasons, this method should be avoided for any patient with impaired corneal sensation (eg, because of concomitant cranial neuropathy or other causes). A more acceptable approach is to place translucent tape over one lens of the patient ’s"
Approach_to_Diplopia.11,"spectacles; some patients prefer to fashion a fabric cover that they place over the frame of one lens. Patients should be assured that occlusion of either eye will mitigate the diplopia, but care should be taken to ensure that the better-seeingeye is not covered. They should also be informed that this method will disrupt binocular vision as it relates to depth perception, so care should be taken when driving or when engaging in other potentially hazardous tasks. Prism Lenses For patients who wear spectacles, a prism lens can be applied to one or both lenses to “bend ”the disparate images into single vision. This is most effective for patients with comitant and relatively small-angle ocular misalignment; for otherpatients this may still be beneficial, but the expectation should be for single vision in primary position (as the prism will not mitigate the incomitant ocular misalignment in all directions of gaze simultaneously). Ideally, a Fresnel (temporary) prism is applied, and the patient is asked to determine over a period of days to weeks whether the prism is effective. This allows for easy adjustment of the prism strength based on the patient ’se x p e r i e n c eo ri nt h e event that the degree of ocular misalignment changes, such as with an improving microvascular cranial nerve VI palsy. Once the appropriate prism strength is confirmed, this can be “ground in ”to a pair of spectacles for full-time wear.KEY POINTS ●Antibody and electrophysiologic testing for myasthenia gravis may be supportive, but this remains a primarily clinical diagnosis. ●Patients with known or suspected thyroid ophthalmopathy should have periodic monitoring with formal visual fields because of the possibility of peripheral vision constriction by compression of the optic nerves as a consequence of enlarging extraocular muscles. ●For patients with new- onset (eg, microvascular) or transient (eg, myasthenia gravis –related) diplopia, monocular occlusion for mitigation of symptoms is immediately effective and can be employed as needed when symptoms are present.

Of note, surgical intervention for diplopia related to MG is rarely recommended as aconsequence of the intermittent and variable nature of the ocular misalignment and the potential for complete recovery with medical therapy. CONCLUSION Diplopia of any pattern or degree is disconcerting to patients and often provokes consternation for the evaluating clinician. However, a systematic approach that relies on a careful history to elucidate candidate sites of localization(brainstem/nuclear, cranial nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle), followed by precise examination techniques to support the most likely etiology, allows for accurate bedside diagnosis in most cases. It is on this basis that the potential for worrisome underlying etiologies can be evaluated and confirmatory diagnostic studies can be judiciously directed. Finally, it is often very comforting for patients to know that diplopia (in most instances) is not associated with pathology that will cause overt vision loss. Furthermore, although the elimination of the underlying cause (if possible) is ideal, the symptom of double vision can always be mitigated. Interventions range from simple monocular occlusion to eye alignment surgery, but the patient need not expect that long-term resolution is in question. REFERENCES 1 Norton JW, Corbett JJ.

"nweman-toker, 2009","A three-step bedside oculomotor exam  (H.I.N.T.S.: Head-Impulse—Nystagmus—Test-of-Skew) appears more sensitive for stroke than  early MRI in AVS. Keywords vertigo; diagnosis; cerebrovascular accident; neurologic examination; sensitivity and specificity Acute vestibular syndrome  (AVS) is characterized by the rapid onset (over seconds to hours)  of vertigo, nausea/vomiting, and gait unsteadiness in association with head-motion  intolerance and nystagmus, lasting days to weeks. Patients often have a self-limited,  presumed-viral cause for their symptoms known as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis,  classified together as acute peripheral vestibulopathy  (APV). Of the 2.6 million emergency  department visits for dizziness or vertigo annually in the US, APV is diagnosed in nearly  150,000.1 However, some patients with AVS instead harbor dangerous brainstem or  cerebellar strokes that mimic APV.2–6 Small observational studies suggest perhaps 25% or  more of acute vestibular syndrome presentations to the emergency department represent  posterior-circulation infarctions.3, 6 CT scans have low sensitivity (~16%) for acute  infarction,7 particularly in the posterior fossa,8 and brain MRI is not always readily  available. Studies also suggest that false negative MRI can occur with acute vertebrobasilar  strokes.6, 9, 10 Consequently, bedside predictors are essential to identify patients with acute  central  vestibulopathies. While classical teaching suggests a focus on long-tract or frank cerebellar signs,11, 12 fewer  than half of AVS presentations have limb ataxia, dysarthria, or other obvious neurologic  features.6 Careful eye movement assessment may be the only bedside method to identify  vertebrobasilar stroke in these patients.8 The most consistent bedside predictor of pseudo- labyrinthine stroke in AVS appears to be the horizontal head impulse test (h-HIT) of  vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function8 (Video 1 a/b). This test was first described in 1988  by Halmagyi and Curthoys as a bedside test for peripheral vestibular disease.13 Some"
"nweman-toker, 2009","authors have suggested the h-HIT be used as a definitive test to distinguish APV from stroke  in AVS patients.4, 14 Recent studies provide evidence that a normal  VOR by h-HIT strongly Newman-Toker et al. Page 2 Stroke . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 October 05. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript indicates a central localization, but an abnormal  VOR is a weaker predictor of a peripheral  localization.5, 6 The sign’s diagnostic utility is diluted principally by the fact that some  patients with abnormal h-HIT (implying APV) actually harbor lateral pontine strokes.6 Another bedside predictor of central pathology in the acute vestibular syndrome is  nystagmus which changes direction on eccentric gaze.5 AVS should generally be associated  with a characteristic, dominantly-horizontal nystagmus that beats only in one direction and  increases in intensity when the patient looks in the direction of the nystagmus fast  phase.15, 16 Vertical or torsional nystagmus in this clinical context is a clear sign of central  pathology, but most strokes presenting an AVS picture have nystagmus with a  predominantly horizontal vector that mimics APV.6 What sometimes distinguishes the  nystagmus typical of central AVS from APV is a change in direction on eccentric gaze6  (Video 2 a/b). A third bedside predictor of central pathology is skew deviation. Skew deviation is vertical  ocular misalignment that results from a right-left imbalance of vestibular tone (i.e., neural  firing), particularly otolithic inputs, to the oculomotor system.17 It often occurs as part of the  pathologic ocular tilt reaction (OTR)—the subtle clinical triad of skew deviation, head tilt,  and ocular counterroll.17 Skew is generally detected by alternate cover testing (Video 3),  with or without a quantifiable prismatic correction. Although reported in patients with  diseases of the vestibular periphery,18 skew (with or without complete OTR) has principally  been identified as a central sign in those with posterior fossa pathology.17 It is most  commonly seen with brainstem strokes17 and has been reported as a herald manifestation of  basilar occlusion."
"nweman-toker, 2009","19 A recent retrospective case-control study comparing oculomotor  features in those with vestibular neuritis (i.e., APV) to those with “vestibular  pseudoneuritis” (mostly due to stroke) suggests skew deviation could be a specific sign of  central disease in AVS patients.5 We sought to assess the diagnostic accuracy of skew deviation for identifying stroke in  AVS, including any added value beyond h-HIT. We hypothesized that the presence of skew  would be insensitive but specific for stroke and that it would add probative diagnostic  information to h-HIT results alone. We further sought to assess the overall sensitivity and  specificity of a three-step bedside oculomotor exam (Head-Impulse—Nystagmus—Test-of- Skew or “H.I.N.T.S.”) for differentiating stroke from APV in AVS. Materials and Methods Data derive from an ongoing study of stroke in AVS patients over the past nine years. The  study methods have been detailed previously in a report of h-HIT findings in 43 subjects6  whose clinical data are also presented here in a larger series (101 subjects). Briefly, we  present results of a prospective, cross-sectional study of patients presenting with AVS,  focusing on those at high risk for stroke. This IRB-approved study was conducted at a single  urban, academic hospital serving as a regional stroke referral center for 25 community  hospitals. Patients with the core features of AVS (rapid onset of vertigo, nausea, vomiting,  and unsteady gait, with or without nystagmus) were identified primarily from the hospital  emergency department (ED). Additional patients were identified by review of stroke Newman-Toker et al. Page 3 Stroke . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 October 05. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript admissions for cerebellar infarction. Included were patients with at least one stroke risk  factor (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, eclampsia,  hypercoagulable state, recent cervical trauma, or prior stroke or myocardial infarction).  Excluded were subjects with a history of prior recurrent vertigo, with or without auditory  symptoms."
"nweman-toker, 2009","For patients consenting to screening, the study neuro-ophthalmologist (JCK) conducted a  neurologic and vestibular examination (including h-HIT, prism cross-cover test for ocular  alignment, and observation of nystagmus in different gaze positions) according to a standard  protocol.6 A search for ocular counterroll by head-upright fundus photography to determine  the presence of complete pathologic OTR was performed in patients with either head tilt or  vertical misalignment (suspected skew) without internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). We  defined severe truncal ataxia as the inability to sit upright unassisted without the use of arms  to stabilize, and included patients where lethargy may have contributed to their inability to  sit. All patients underwent neuroimaging, generally after bedside evaluation. If neuroimaging  was performed prior to the study evaluation, the examiner was masked to these results at the  time of clinical assessment. All patients (including suspected APV patients) were admitted  for observation and underwent serial daily examinations for evolution of clinical findings.  The reference standard for a stroke diagnosis was confirmation of acute stroke by  neuroimaging, generally MRI with DWI on the day of the index visit. The reference  standard for a diagnosis of APV was absence of acute stroke in the brainstem or cerebellum  by MRI with DWI, lack of neurologic signs on serial exam, and a characteristic clinical  course. Most also underwent confirmatory caloric testing of vestibular function. For predictive accuracy of skew deviation, we compared proportions with skew deviation in  peripheral versus central cases, and offer results stratified by h-HIT findings. Based upon  prior literature suggesting that three subtle oculomotor signs (normal h-HIT, direction- changing nystagmus, and skew deviation) might be, in aggregate, the best predictor of stroke  in AVS,8 we analyzed these three signs together. A priori, we defined the H.I.N.T.S. exam  as either benign  (abnormal h-HIT plus direction-fixed horizontal nystagmus plus absent  skew) or dangerous  (normal/untestable h-HIT or direction-changing horizontal nystagmus  present/untestable or skew deviation present/untestable) and compared this test battery’s  sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for the presence of stroke relative to other"
"nweman-toker, 2009","neurologic findings and early MRI with DWI. We calculate both positive  likelihood ratios  (the extent to which dangerous H.I.N.T.S. increase the odds of stroke or “rule in” the  disease) and negative  likelihood ratios (the extent to which benign H.I.N.T.S. decrease the  odds of stroke or “rule out” the disease). Fisher’s exact and Pearson’s chi-squared were used  for comparison of proportions with SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Likelihood  ratios and confidence intervals were calculated with MedCalc 9.6 (MedCalc Software,  Mariakerke, Belgium). All p-values were two-sided, with p<0.05 considered significant.Newman-Toker et al. Page 4 Stroke . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 October 05. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Results We screened 121 AVS patients and excluded 19 for a history of recurrent vertigo or  dizziness (7 Menière syndrome, 5 vestibular migraine, 4 idiopathic recurrent vertigo, and 3  other disorders). One eligible subject refused enrollment. Of 101 patients reported here, 92  were identified by primary clinical screening, and 9 through review of admitted cerebellar  infarcts. Fifty-nine presented initially to the ED, 4 were inpatients at symptom onset, 1  presented as an outpatient, and 37 were transferred to the neurology ward from other  institutions (mostly from affiliate hospital EDs admitted directly to the stroke service). The study population was 65% men with a mean age of 62 years (standard deviation 13  years, range 26–92). The age range for stroke patients was 26–92 with 15 patients under age  50, including 6 under age 40. In 30%, only 1 stroke-risk factor was present; the others had at  least 2 risk factors. Most were examined within 24 hours of symptom onset (75%). In 5  patients, the precise time of exam relative to symptom onset was unclear, because the  precise time of symptom onset was unknown. Among the remaining 96 patients, the mean  time to first examination was 26 hours (range 1 hour to 9 days)."
"nweman-toker, 2009","Most patients (97%) underwent stroke-protocol MRI at the time of admission. One patient  underwent CT followed by open MRI at another facility because of claustrophobia, and 3  underwent CT but no MRI (one was claustrophobic, one died prior to obtaining MRI, and  one required ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement and was too ill for MRI). All 3 who did  not have MRI had unequivocal cerebellar stroke by CT. Initial imaging occurred within 6  hours of study examination in most (70%). Among the 96 patients in whom time of  symptom onset was known, imaging occurred within 72 hours of symptom onset in 97%;  two patients were imaged at 4 days and one at 9 days after AVS onset. Eight with initial  negative MRI underwent repeat MRI for unexplained signs (on initial or follow ‐up  examination) suggesting brainstem localization. No patients suffered complications from  diagnostic testing, other than one claustrophobic reaction. Of 101 high-risk AVS patients, 25 had APV and 76 had a central lesion. Peripheral lesions  were confirmed by caloric testing in 22 patients (19 with canal paresis, usually severe; 3  with only directional preponderance); two patients could not complete testing due to  discomfort and one refused. Central lesions included 69 ischemic strokes, 4 hemorrhages (1  dentate nucleus, 3 pontine [2 with pontine cavernoma]), 2 demyelinating disease (1  presumed midbrain lesion, 1 medullary lesion), and 1 anticonvulsant toxicity  (carbamazepine). Two patients did not have a demonstrable structural lesion on MRI that  corresponded with the acute clinical syndrome (1 patient with seesaw nystagmus and a  presumed midbrain lesion who had demyelinating lesions elsewhere in the brain and the  patient with anticonvulsant toxicity). Key clinical features suggesting a central localization  (n=76) are presented in Table 1. These features are stratified by stroke location for ischemic  lesions (n=69) in Table 2. Acute auditory symptoms were infrequent but associated with strokes in the AICA territory  and presumed secondary to labyrinthine infarction, cochlear nucleus involvement, or both."

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript (38% vs. 12%, p=0.02). All patients were unsteady (i.e., broad-based gait or difficulty with  tandem walking), but severe truncal ataxia (inability to sit without the use of arms or  assistance) was seen only among those with central lesions (34% vs. 0%, p<0.001). As  expected, lateral medullary (n=7), lateral pontine (n=5), and inferior cerebellar strokes  (n=12) frequently mimicked APV (absent general neurologic or obvious oculomotor signs)  while medial brainstem cerebrovascular events did not (45% vs. 5%, p=0.001). Another  36% of these lateral brainstem and cerebellar events (including one dentate hemorrhage) had  severe truncal ataxia as their only obvious sign. Not surprisingly, medially-located brainstem  strokes and hemorrhages were associated with oculomotor paralysis while lateral brainstem  and cerebellar cerebrovascular events were not (80% vs. 0%, p<0.001). Skew deviation (mean 9.9 prism-diopters, range 3–20) was present in 17% of our 101  subjects (case descriptions in online supplement) and untestable in 4% with central lesions  due to seesaw nystagmus or oculomotor paralysis. Despite the large vertical ocular  deviations, only three patients complained of symptomatic diplopia at presentation, and two  of these had co-morbid INO; several patients became aware of their diplopia during the  cross cover test or developed symptomatic diplopia days or weeks after presentation as their  oscillopsia abated. Skew was evident in 4% (n=1/25) with APV, 4% (n=1/24) with pure  cerebellar lesions, and 30% (n=15/50) with demonstrated structural brainstem involvement"
"nweman-toker, 2009","(χ2 p=0.003). A complete OTR was found in 6 subjects, all with brainstem strokes (2 lateral  medullary, 2 lateral pontine, 2 interstitial nucleus of Cajal). Results of cross-cover testing for  skew deviation, stratified by h-HIT result, are compared to final diagnosis based on  neuroimaging and clinical follow-up in Table 3. The majority (59%) of skews were  associated with lateral medullary or lateral pontine strokes. Finding a skew correctly  predicted the presence of a central lesion in 2 of 3 cases of lateral pontine stroke where a  positive h-HIT incorrectly suggested benign APV and 7 of 8 cases with false negative initial  MRI. Taking skew together with h-HIT and direction-changing nystagmus as a three-step  bedside exam battery, a dangerous H.I.N.T.S. result was 100% sensitive and 96% specific  for the presence of a central lesion, giving a positive likelihood ratio of 25 (95%CI 3.66– 170.59) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.00 (95%CI 0.00–0.11). Compared to traditional  findings thought to indicate brainstem or cerebellar involvement in AVS, the H.I.N.T.S.  battery was more sensitive than general neurologic signs (100% vs. 51%), obvious  oculomotor signs (100% vs. 32%), or both of these taken together (100% vs. 67%) (all  p<0.001). Neuroimaging by MRI with DWI was falsely negative in 8 ischemic stroke patients (5  lateral medullary, 1 lateral ponto-medullary, and 2 middle cerebellar peduncle infarctions).  Negative scans were obtained 8–48 hours after symptom onset, including 4 that were  negative at 24 hours or beyond. Follow-up MRI an average of 3 days later (range 2 to 10  days) revealed the strokes. The sensitivity of early MRI with DWI for lateral medullary or  pontine infarction was lower than that of the bedside exam (72% vs. 100%, p=0.004) with  comparable specificity (100% vs."

Four were diagnosed radiographically with vertebral artery  dissection, all young (ages 26, 35, 42, 52).Newman-Toker et al. Page 6 Stroke . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 October 05. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Imaging evidence of mass effect was seen in the initial scan in nine patients, and in follow- up scan in one patient, all with cerebellar involvement. Among these 10 of 23 patients with  cerebellar infarction, 3 were lethargic, but 7 had isolated, severe truncal ataxia without other  obvious neurologic signs at or near the time of imaging showing mass effect. In the majority  of APV patients (92%), MRI revealed non-specific areas of periventricular high signal  intensity on T2 or FLAIR imaging but normal DWI compatible with chronic gliosis,  presumed secondary to ischemic leukoencephalopathy in this population with one or more  stroke risk factors. Discussion Our study demonstrates that skew deviation in AVS is strongly linked to the presence of  brainstem lesions, most often ischemic strokes in the lateral medulla or pons. This study also  proves that finding one of three dangerous, subtle oculomotor signs (normal h-HIT or  horizontal nystagmus that changes direction in eccentric gaze or skew deviation) is more  sensitive than the combined presence of all other traditional neurologic signs for identifying  stroke as a cause of AVS. The dangerous signs can be remembered using the acronym  I.N.F.A.R.C.T. (Impulse Normal, Fast-phase Alternating, Refixation on Cover Test).  Perhaps most importantly, we have shown that a benign H.I.N.T.S. exam result at the  bedside “rules out” stroke better than a negative MRI with DWI in the first 24–48 hours  after symptom onset, with acceptable specificity (96%). The association between skew deviation and brainstem stroke is not surprising. Although"
"nweman-toker, 2009","cases of primary-position skew have been reported with peripheral vestibular disease and  alternating skew deviation in lateral gaze is seen in some patients with bilateral  cerebellopathy, lesions causing skew and the pathologic OTR have most often been found in  the brainstem.17 Our prospective findings build on prior retrospective work suggesting a  strong link between subtle oculomotor signs and stroke in patients with central AVS  mimicking APV.4, 5 Although a normal h-HIT remains the single best bedside predictor of  stroke6 and its test properties are comparable to those of early MRI DWI, roughly one in ten  strokes will still be missed if other findings are not considered. We have identified two other  subtle findings that should improve bedside detection of stroke without substantial loss of  specificity. Although physicians have become increasingly reliant on MRI DWI for acute stroke  diagnosis, our study presents further evidence that care should be taken not to use DWI  alone to rule out stroke in AVS in the first 24–48 hours after symptom onset. In our series,  the sensitivity of DWI was 88% overall and 72% for lateral medullary and lateral pontine  infarctions, with these localizations very frequent among vertebrobasilar strokes mimicking  APV closely. These estimates echo results from two prior studies of early DWI that reported  on 206 vertebrobasilar strokes and found 77% sensitivity within 24 hours of symptom  onset.9, 10 Frontline misdiagnosis of posterior circulation strokes presenting with dizziness appears  common, occurring in perhaps 35% of cases.20 The high rate of misdiagnosis may not be  surprising given that 58% of patients in our series either had no obvious signs or had only Newman-Toker et al. Page 7 Stroke . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 October 05. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript isolated, severe truncal ataxia. Inappropriate reliance on CT to exclude stroke likely  exacerbates the problem.21, 22 The consequences of such misdiagnoses can be profound,  with one small series of missed cerebellar infarctions indicating adverse outcomes in 40%.21  Misdiagnosis may be more likely in younger patients who are not generally considered to be"
"nweman-toker, 2009","at risk for stroke.21 Vertebral artery dissections, the leading identifiable cause of posterior  circulation stroke among young adults,23 can present with an APV mimic.24 We found 15 of  our stroke patients were under age 50, and 3 of these were due to dissections. Although the bedside techniques in the H.I.N.T.S. exam are not widely known among  emergency physicians, internists, or even general neurologists, non-neuro-otologists can  accurately interpret subtle oculomotor findings of this type,25 suggesting that training in the  use of these techniques may be possible. The three components of the H.I.N.T.S. (h-HIT of  VOR function; observation for nystagmus in primary, right, and left gaze; alternate cover  test for skew deviation) can be tested in approximately 1 minute at the bedside, while a more  thorough, traditional neurologic exam generally takes 5–10 minutes or more. An acute MRI  brain with DWI takes at least 5–10 minutes of scan time plus a wait time of several hours to  several days and typically costs more than $1000. In an era where efficiency and cost  containment are at a premium, this bedside method may offer a quick, inexpensive  alternative to current practice. While additional confirmatory studies in a broader range of  acute vestibular patients are needed, our data suggest that in time-pressured, frontline  healthcare settings this approach could potentially supplant complete neurologic  examination and neuroimaging without loss of diagnostic accuracy. We identified several possible limitations to our study findings. Threats to internal validity  include a partially-unmasked examiner and selective MRI follow-up scans. As described  previously,6 the study examiner (JCK), though masked to the results of imaging, was not  masked to the patient’s clinical history, general neurologic exam, or obvious oculomotor  findings when testing for subtler eye signs. Observer bias in the interpretation of subtle eye  findings could have artificially inflated the sensitivity of these signs, but this seems unlikely  for the 33% of cases where obvious neurologic findings were absent. MRI follow-up scans  were obtained in only selected cases based on evolution of new neurologic signs or atypical  subtle oculomotor signs."
"nweman-toker, 2009","This selective re-testing could have led to some misclassification of  strokes as APV, increasing the apparent sensitivity of the H.I.N.T.S. battery. However, all of  these APV patients were followed and evolved no neurologic deficits acutely nor suffered  strokes in clinical follow-up. Threats to external validity include generalizability of examination technique and sampling  from a high-risk subpopulation. Since patients were evaluated by a single examiner, it is  unknown whether clinical findings could have been replicated by other examiners. The  growing literature on these subtle eye signs from multiple investigators suggests  reproducibility, at least among subspecialists in the field.4–6 We restricted our enrollment to  high-risk AVS patients with no history of prior recurrent vertigo and at least one stroke risk  factor. We chose this approach because funds were not available to image all low-risk  patients in whom MRI could not be justified clinically. This selection led to a highly- enriched cerebrovascular cohort (76% central, 73% cerebrovascular, 69% ischemic stroke)  and APV patients who might be atypical (92% with leukoariosis). It is possible that a Newman-Toker et al. Page 8 Stroke . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 October 05. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript broader spectrum of APV patients could have disclosed more with negative h-HIT results  (including those with isolated inferior vestibular neuritis26) or the other two subtle signs,  reducing the specificity of the “dangerous” H.I.N.T.S. result. However, a previous study of  unselected AVS patients suggests otherwise, estimating a 92% specificity when subtle eye  signs were considered in a statistical prediction model.5 Summary As has been shown previously, we found that lateral medullary, lateral pontine, and inferior  cerebellar infarctions mimic APV very closely, and great caution must be exercised to avoid  missing these posterior circulation strokes in AVS patients. One in five strokes causing AVS  affects a patient under age 50 and one in ten a patient under age 40. Typical neurologic signs  are absent in roughly half, and more than half of those with mass effect from large cerebellar"
"nweman-toker, 2009","infarctions have only severe truncal ataxia without other obvious neurologic or oculomotor  signs. Initial MRIs are falsely negative in 12% and can prove misleading out to 48 hours  after symptom onset. Skew deviation is an insensitive marker of central pathology but fairly specific predictor of  brainstem involvement among AVS patients. The presence of skew may help identify stroke  when a positive h-HIT falsely suggests a peripheral lesion. Screening AVS patients for one  of three dangerous oculomotor signs (normal h-HIT, direction-changing nystagmus, skew  deviation) appears to be more sensitive than MRI with DWI in detecting acute stroke in the  first 24–48 hours after symptom onset. These “H.I.N.T.S. to I.N.F.A.R.C.T.” could help  reduce frontline misdiagnosis of patients with stroke in AVS and should be studied head-to- head for their comparative cost-effectiveness against neuroimaging by MRI DWI.

CURRENTOPINION Skew deviation: clinical up dates for ophthalmologists Aditya Hernowo and Eric Eggenberger Purpose of review This article discusses the current approach in diagnosing skew deviation, as well as recent findings in the lesion localization. Recent findings Skew deviation can be defined as vertical misalignment of the eyes that does not map to any of cyclovertical muscles, in association with neurologic symptoms and signs and with posterior fossa lesion. It can be differentiated from trochlear nerve palsy by the direction of ocular torsion and the change in the degree of vertical deviation with upright and supine head position. It is commonly caused by ischemia of the posterior paramedian pons, medial thalamus, or cerebellum. Other less common mechanism being demyelinating lesion, mass effect, infection, hemorrhage, or intracranial hypertension. When the vestibular nuclei are involved, skew deviation may occur with acute vestibular syndrome. Ground-in or Fresnel prism may alleviate diplopia in relatively small vertical deviation; however, patient with larger deviation or with the presence of ocular torsion may benefit from surgery of the cyclovertical muscles. Summary Skew deviation can be appropriately diagnosed from the nature of the ocular torsion and the vertical deviation, along with the presence of lesion involving posterior paramedian pons and/or medial thalamus. Keywords medial thalamus, posterior paramedian pons, skew deviation, upright-supine test INTRODUCTION Skew deviation was first described by Magendie and Hertwig in 1833 and 1855, respectively, hence the name Magendie-Hertwig sign. Before the early 1980s, skew deviation was perceived as uncommon vertical ocular misalignment due to posterior fossa lesion. It is now known as a common vertical mis- alignment of the eyes because of the disturbance of vestibular input (otolithic pathways) to ocular motor nuclei [1]. These disturbances occur in either the brainstem, cerebellum, or peripherally involv- ing the vestibular nerve or organs. It can be com- itant, noncomitant, or alternating. Diagnosing skew"
hernowo2014,"deviation may still be challenging, especially for ophthalmologists. This review emphasizes on our latest understanding on the diagnosis of skew devi- ation and lesion localization. CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS Vertical misalignment of the eyes may be due to paresis of the nerve innervating of any of the cyclo- vertical extraocular muscles, supranuclear disorder, or other mechanism. The following paragraphs focus on differentiating between the trochlear nerve palsy from skew deviation. Wong [2&&] defined skew deviation as vertical misalignment that does not map to any ofcyclovertical muscles, in association with neuro- logic symptoms and signs, and posterior fossa lesion on MRI. In the presence of normally functioning vestibulo-ocular reflex, head tilt to one side is balanced to some extent by the eyes rolling to the opposite side (ocular counter-roll reflex). Thus, head tilt to the right is followed by ocular torsion to the left. If the vestibulo-ocular reflex mechanism failed, the counter balancing mechanism will not take place. For example, head tilt to the right is accom- panied by ocular torsion also to the right, instead of to the left [ocular tilt response (OTR)]. Vertical devi- ation can be a part of the OTR, comprising ocular torsion, head tilt, and skew deviation. The presence of skew deviation may or may not be associated with the change in subjective visual vertical (SVV). For example, Baier et al.

In primary position, both skew deviation and trochlear nerve palsy present with hypertropia. Unilateral trochlear nerve palsy causes weakness of ipsilateral superior oblique muscle and less-opposed supraduction, resulting in hypertropia and inability of the affected eye to incyclotort. Because of that, compensatory contralateral head tilt position is assumed to minimize or eliminate vertical diplopia. In skew deviation, instead of being compensatory (hypertropia may or may not be affected with tilt [2&&]), head tilt reflects underlying pathophysiology, as a patient’s SVV is tilted toward the side of the head tilt [4]. For example, a patient with right hypertropia and head tilt to the left may either have right trochlear nerve palsy or skew deviation. If the same patient has excyclotorted right eye and incyclotorted left eye, then the head tilt is compensatory and right trochlear nerve palsy is the most likely explanation. Whereas if the patient has incyclotorted right eye and excyclo- torted left eye, then skew deviation is the most likely diagnosis. These show that one cannot rely on ver- tical deviation to clinically diagnose skew deviation. Nonetheless, skew deviation can be differentiated from trochlear nerve palsy by the direction of the ocular torsion [5]: in trochlear nerve palsy, the hyper- tropic eye is excyclotorted, whereas in skew devi- ation, the hypertropic eye is incyclotorted. As mentioned before, one cannot rely on verti- cal deviation to clinically diagnose skew deviation. However, a new clinical test was proposed by Wong [2&&] – the upright-supine test – to differentiate skew deviation from trochlear nerve palsy on the basis of vertical deviation. In their study, the degree of vertical misalignment was stable in either upright and supine head position in the case of unilateral trochlear nerve palsy. Conversely, the amount of vertical misalignment was improved at least 50% in"
hernowo2014,"skew deviation by changing the upright to supine head position. The test reportedly had a sensitivity and specificity of 76 and 100%, respectively [2&&].Cause and localization Skew deviation is commonly caused by ischemia of brainstem or cerebellum. Among many causes are basilar artery occlusion. The basilar artery is formed by the joining of the vertebral arteries. It gives of pairs of branches – in caudo-rostral direction – posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, and superior cerebellar arteries. Herpes simplex virus vasculitis, which appeared as an MRI enhancement of the involved vessel, was associated with stenosis of the basilar artery and posterior paramedian pontine stroke [6&]. To be more specific, unilateral stroke anterior to the aque- duct of Sylvius [7–10,11&], and/or the medial aspect of the ipsilateral thalamus [9,10,12&], was reported with skew deviation and vertical gaze palsy. As the medial longitudinal fasciculus is involved in horizontal gaze, although the rostral aspect of the medial longitudinal fasciculus – the rostral intersti- tial nucleus (riMLF) – is involved in vertical sac- cades, horizontal or vertical gaze palsy, including internuclear ophthalmoplegia [8], may coexist with skew deviation. Nonetheless, vertical strabismus may be found in up to 57% isolated unilateral abduction deficit [13]. In this scenario, the vertical deviation is more likely because of mechanical cause or to nerve-muscle tone imbalance rather than skew deviation. Apart from pontine stroke, unilateral involve- ment of posterior inferior cerebellar arteries or anterior inferior cerebellar arteries may cause uni- lateral cerebellar infarction with skew deviation in addition to acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) [14]. However, if the AVS was caused by unilateral infarc- tion restricted to the vestibular nuclei (medial and inferior) [15], or restricted to unilateral flocculus or tonsil, skew deviation was absent [15]. However, if the lesion is restricted to unilateral flocculus or"
hernowo2014,"tonsil [16], skew deviation may be absent [16]. As the utricular input from the semicircular canals primarily terminate in the lateral vestibular nucleus of Deiters [17], this may explain the absence of skew deviation in the restricted involvement of the other vestibular nuclei. Other pathophysiology may also produce skew deviation. It occurred in 13.5% patient with tumor [18], multiple sclerosis [19,20], infection [21], hemorrhage [22], vestibular neuritis [23], and increased intracranial pressure [24]. In multiple sclerosis with skew deviation, the demyelinating plaque was found unilaterally at the ‘middle cerebel- lar peduncle with satellite lesion probably extend- ing to pontine 8th nerve fascicle’ [20]. Yet again, involvement of the vestibular nerve fascicle is not always followed by skew deviation. In a case reported by Veros et al .

Treatment Binocular vertical diplopia from skew deviation can be managed by monocular occlusion temporarily. It may be managed with prism [26] if the deviation is comitant, relatively small, with minimal or no ocular torsion [27]. Relatively moderate or large vertical deviation may not be amenable with prism, especially the ones with ocular torsion. In this situation, surgery can be considered. Surgical management of skew deviation commonly involved"
hernowo2014,"vertical rectus recession or resection, for oblique muscle surgery was not associated with good out- comes [27]. One study reported the treatment of skew deviation with injection of botulinum toxin A into the superior rectus muscle [28]. CONCLUSION Skew deviation is vertical misalignment of the eyes from supranuclear disorder involving the otolith- ocular pathways. It may be found in association with the OTR and may present itself as a part of AVS. A decrease of 50% or more in vertical deviation from upright to supine head position is indicative of skew deviation, instead of trochlear nerve palsy. In addition, incyclotorsion of the hypertropic eye is also suggestive of skew deviation. From reports reviewed here, we obtained relatively consistent localization of lesion responsible for the deviation: first, anterior to the aqueduct of Sylvius in the rostral aspect of the tegmentum (posterior paramedian pons), or second, medial aspect of posterior thalamus, or third, cerebellar hemisphere, or fourth, peripheral vestibular organ. The definitive treatment of skew deviation includes prism spectacles and surgery of cyclovertical muscles. Future study on skew deviation may benefit more with high resol- ution imaging of the brain stem and the midbrain. Acknowledgements None. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.

It is considered as a central sign, however, the  prevalence of skew and the accuracy of its test is not well known. Methods We performed a prospective study from February 2015 until September 2020 of all patients presenting at our  emergency department (ED) with signs of AVS. All patients underwent clinical HINTS and video test of skew (vTS) fol- lowed by a delayed MRI, which served as a gold standard for vestibular stroke confirmation. Results We assessed 58 healthy subjects, 53 acute unilateral vestibulopathy patients (AUVP) and 24 stroke patients. Skew  deviation prevalence was 24% in AUVP and 29% in strokes. For a positive clinical test of skew, the cut-off of vertical mis- alignment was 3 deg with a very low sensitivity of 15% and specificity of 98.2%. The sensitivity of vTS was 29.2% with a  specificity of 75.5%. Conclusions Contrary to prior knowledge, skew deviation proved to be more prevalent in patients with AVS and occurred  in every forth patient with AUVP.

It is considered  as a central sign in patients with an acute vestibular syn- drome (AVS) [2 ]; however, the prevalence of skew is not  well known. Vertical eye deviation usually does not occur  in isolation, but is accompanied by ocular counter-roll and  associated head tilt in dizzy patients. This triad is known as  ocular tilt reaction (OTR) [3 ]. Although skew deviation is  predominately seen in patients with central lesions, periph- eral causes of vertigo have also been reported in the litera- ture [4 ]. However, skew deviation is reported to be smaller  in peripheral lesions than in central causes [5 ]. Patients with AVS often do not mention vertical double  vision because other symptoms, such as rotatory vertigo,  nausea, and vomiting are more prominent in the acute state.  It is therefore important that emergency physicians actively  look for skew deviation, which is also integrated in the  * Georgios Mantokoudis   georgios.mantokoudis@insel.ch 1 Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck  Surgery, Inselspital, University Hospital Bern and University  of Bern, Bern, Switzerland 2 University Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional  Neuroradiology, Inselspital, University Hospital Bern  and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland 3 Department of Emergency Medicine, Inselspital, University"

Skew deviation can be clinically  assessed at the bedside using the cross-cover or alternating- cover test (aka as test of skew). This test can be challenging  in the presence of spontaneous nystagmus and needs exper - tise, which may often not be available in smaller community  hospitals. Nowadays, the use of video-oculography (VOG), assists  physicians to quantify eye movements [7 ]. VOG is already  used for the quantification of the head impulse test [8 ]; how - ever, there are no reports about skew quantification by VOG  in the emergency department (video Test of Skew, vTS). In this prospective cross-sectional study, we sought to  quantify eye misalignments in healthy subjects and to deter - mine the prevalence of skew deviation in patients with AVS.  We further assessed the diagnostic accuracy of clinical Test  of Skew (cTS) versus video test of skew (vTS) for predicting  stroke in the emergency department. Materials and methods Healthy subjects We included 58 healthy subjects aged from 21 to 77 years  without prior vestibular problems. A prerequisite for being  considered healthy was a normal video head impulse test  and a negative history of vertigo. We report normative data  segregated by age decades including a minimal dataset of  ten subjects per age group. Patients with acute vestibular syndrome We enrolled AVS patients who met the inclusion criteria  such as continuous dizziness, associated with nausea or  vomiting, head-motion intolerance, new gait or balance  disturbance, and nystagmus as part of a prospective cross- sectional study of patients seen in the emergency department  (ED) (DETECT—Dizziness Evaluation Tool for Emergent  Clinical Triage) between 07/2015 and 04/2020. We excluded"
s00415-021-10692-6,"patients younger than 18 years, if symptoms lasted < 24 h  or if the index ED visit was > 72 h after symptom onset.  We also excluded patients with previous eye movement or  vestibular disorders. A neurootologist with an average of two  years experience in the field performed a physical exami- nation with clinical HINTS assessment, Caloric Testing,  and video-TS testing in all enrolled patients. All patients  received an acute MRI either within 48 h in the ED or a  second, delayed MRI, if based on clinical grounds there was  no acute MRI indicated or if the first acute MRI was non- diagnostic. The delayed MRI served as a gold standard for  stroke detection. Patients with a negative MRI and either a  pathological head impulse test or pathological caloric test were diagnosed as acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUVP)/ vestibular neuritis. Additionally, we collected information  on age and gender. We recorded the vertical ocular misalignment using a  VOG device (EyeSeeCam, Munich) with an infrared video  camera, and a frame rate of 220 Hz. The VOG device was  calibrated by projecting dots on a TV screen or a tablet  with a predefined distance (Tablet: Distance eyes to target:  260 mm, Target Size: 4 mm, Luminosity: 6.17 Lux, Angu- lar size: 0.89 degrees. TV Screen: Distance eyes to target:  55 cm, Target Size: 5 mm, Luminosity: 11.8 Lux., Angular  Size: 0.23 degrees). The vertical ocular misalignment was  tested by fixating a dot displayed in the center of a TV screen  or tablet. We used color-filtered glasses on both eyes (red  filter for left eye and blue filter for right eye). The color  filters allowed for a monochromatic view of the target dot,  which changed periodically every 2 s from red to blue and  vice versa. We maintained a standardized upright/ verti- cal head position using a chin rest avoiding any head tilt.  Skew deviation was quantitatively reported in degrees (eye  position) or converted into diopters. We report here the eye  misalignment in degrees throughout the manuscript. Details"
s00415-021-10692-6,"of the applied method how to measure skew with VOG is  reported elsewhere [9 ]. Statistics All statistics were reported using SPSS statistical software  (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. Armonk,  NY: IBM Corp). We determined thresholds of physi- ological vertical ocular misalignments in healthy subjects  using the 95th percentile. We used a non-parametric test  (Kruskal–Wallis Test) to test for any effect of age and gender  since the data were not normally distributed. Skew deviation  exceeding the 95th percentile of the normatives was consid- ered as a positive skew. For the comparison of the vertical ocular misalignment  between central and peripheral disorders, we only included  patients with a confirmed stroke or AUVP and used a mul- tivariate linear regression analysis taking into account the  time interval between symptom onset and recording time. We calculated the receiver characteristics curves (ROC)  for VOG vertical misalignment and stroke prediction. The  threshold for detecting clinically a positive skew was also  determined by a ROC curve. We used cross-tabulations to assess specificity (spec) and  sensitivity (sens) for tests such as cTS and ‘HINTS’ with  binary outcomes in predicting strokes. We evaluated stroke  predictors using a binary logistic regression. The number  needed to diagnose (NND) was calculated as follows: 1/ (sens + spec-1). NND reflects the number of patients who  need to be tested to correctly diagnose one person with  stroke. 1398 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:1396–1403 1 3 Results Normative data from 58 healthy subjects are shown in  table S1 and Fig.  1, stratified by age groups. Age (p  = 0.887)  and gender (p  = 0.464) did not statistically affect test  results. Based on our normative data, we considered a cut- off > 0.81 deg (95th percentile) as an abnormal vertical ocu- lar misalignment. We screened 1677 patients with acute dizziness of which  152 AVS patients aged between 20 and 91 (mean 55.67y)  were enrolled. Out of 152 patients, 58 were diagnosed"
s00415-021-10692-6,"with AUVP (mean age 54y  + / − 15.7y) and 27 patients  with vestibular strokes (mean age 62.1y  + / − 15.9y). Fig - ure 1S (Appendix) shows a flow diagram with all screened  patients, inclusions, and exclusions of dizzy patients. We  analyzed data from 77 patients (aged between 20 and 88,  mean 56.58y + / − 15.9y) with a diagnosis of stroke or AUVP  and a valid vertical ocular misalignment measurement (53  with AUVP and 24 with stroke). Mean interval time from  symptoms onset to VOG recordings was 29.7 h and, ranged  from 1 to 74 h without statistically significant difference  in both groups (p  = 0.075). In addition, nystagmus intensity  under fixation with gaze straight ahead was not correlated  to the grade of skew deviation in light (Pearson Correlation,  p = 0.489) and in darkness (p  = 0.886). The prevalence for skew deviation in AVS patients was  26% (20 out of 77). Skew prevalence in patients with AUVP  was 24.5% (13/57) and 29.2% (7/24) in stroke patients. Figure  2 shows the eye recordings of vTS in a patient with  acute stroke (A) with 11.5 deg vertical ocular misalignment  and AUVP (B) with 2.8 deg. Both patients reported vertical  double vision. The stroke patient also presented with a lat- erodeviation, which is considered as a central sign [10]. Fig- ure 3 shows the box-plots whiskers and the outliers of verti- cal ocular misalignment in patients with AUVP and stroke. There was statistically no difference in skew deviation  between AUVP (median 0.37 deg + / − SE 0.10 deg, range  from 0 deg to 3.26 deg) and stroke (median 0.32 deg + / − SE  0.48 deg, range from 0.02 deg to 11.49 deg) (p  = 0."
s00415-021-10692-6,"184),  however, all patients (n  = 2) with skew larger than 3.3 deg  were found to be strokes (see extreme outliers, Fig.  3). The  threshold for physicians to discern a vertical skew clinically  was found to be at 3 deg deviation (5.25 prisms). Only six  patients with skew deviation less than 3 deg reported dou- ble vision. One of them had a vestibular neuritis. Table S3  shows the characteristics of patients with a stroke. The clini- cians performing the test of skew clinically had a very low  sensitivity of 15% but a high specificity of 98.2% to detect  skew greater than 0.81 deg. We did not find a significant discrimination cut-off of  skew deviation between AUVP and strokes (AUC = 0.505,  p = 0.943, CI 0.365–0.645, Fig.  4). The receiver operator  characteristics curve (ROC) followed the depicted diagonal  line representing a likelihood ratio of 1. The sensitivity of a clinical test of skew to detect a stroke  was 12.5%, the specificity 98.1% and its accuracy 71%  (Cross table S2). The overall sensitivity in discriminating  strokes with video test of skew (vTS), when vertical ocu- lar misalignment was > 0.81 deg (arbitrary cut-off based on  positive skew from normative data), was higher at 29.2%  with a specificity of 75.5% (Fig.  4). The accuracy of vTS  was 61%. Figure  5 shows a density plot for skew deviation  in patients with AUVP and strokes. We chose additional  skew deviation cut-offs (Fig.  5) for stroke detection either  based on the AUVP population distribution (two standard  deviations from the mean) or, being less conservative, the  maximum skew value for AUVP (> 3.3°). These cut-offs  resulted in a higher specificity of 96.2% for stroke detection  (Cut-off  > 2.6°) and 98.1% (cut-off 3.3°) for stroke detection.  Sensitivity remained low at 8."

Although in the literature, there are many case reports  [11–14] of skew deviation as a rare sign in peripheral defi- cits, to our knowledge, there is no study evaluating the  prevalence of skew measured with VOG goggles in AUVP  patients. In our study, the prevalence of a pathological verti- cal ocular misalignment was almost identical in both, AUVP  and vestibular strokes. Kattah et al. [6 ] reported a lower"
s00415-021-10692-6,"prevalence of skew (tested with prism cover test) in periph- eral AVS patients (4%), and an almost similar prevalence in  central AVS patients (25%). One reason for these discrepan- cies could be a selection bias due to a relative low proportion  of peripheral AVS in their study compared to ours. Carmona  et al. in 2016 [15] also reported only four patients with skew  (tested with the alternate cover test) out of 72 AUVP which  is in line with our study when only our results of the clini- cal alternate cover test are considered. Since most of the  AVS patients had a skew lower than 3 deg, which is not  detectable by a human eye when nystagmus is present, the  detection of skew in previous studies was probably underes- timated. In addition, superior nerve division neuritis elicits  a mixed horizontal/torsional nystagmus with a small verti- cal component, which can be falsely interpreted as skew. It  is, however, questionable whether such small vertical fast  phase movements would be discernable without VOG. We  did not find skew differences between both cohorts (AUVP  vs. stroke) with regard to gender. We found, however, dif- ferences in age between both groups, which is in agreement  with other studies who report that patients with strokes are  usually older [16]. Albeit we have shown that skew is more common than  reported in the current literature on strokes and AUVP,  we have not found a peripheral case with skew more than  3.3 deg (5.8 diopters). That means that a patient with a very  large skew deviation (> 3.3 deg) is more likely to have a  stroke. Such large skews are also clinically detectable and  there is no absolute need for a VOG device; however, this  holds only true for experts trained in eye movement assess- ment. This finding cannot be generalized to emergency phy - sicians or non-experts. A VOG device, however, enables  physicians to measure skew quantitatively and in a stand- ardized way regardless of the skills of the examiner [17, 18]. Previous studies [ 19] used a semi-quantitative method for  skew detection and assessed a high proportion of patients"
s00415-021-10692-6,"with stroke in their cohort. Thus, they reported a higher  specificity. The most accurate test for detecting a stroke in AVS  patients was the head impulse test. This finding is consistent  with previous studies [ 20]. Moreover, we found that the test  of skew included in the ‘HINTS’ battery did not increase the  diagnostic accuracy significantly but conversely increased  the number of false positive results.

s00415-021-10692-6,"with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96% [ 6]. Our  clinical diagnostic accuracy was lower possibly due to the  2 years of neurotological experience of the examiner com- pared to experts in the field. There was no discrimination cut-off for diagnosing stroke  based on vTS alone, however, taking an arbitrary cut-off of  0.81° (positive skew based on normative data), we demon- strated an increase in sensitivity (29.2%) compared to the  low sensitivity of the clinical test (12.5%). The application of HINTS with vTS increased the test  sensitivity by 4%points, however, its specificity decreased  by 17%points. The number needed to diagnose (NND) for  clinical skew was 1.5 vs. 1.8 for vTS. This means that the  number of patients needed to test for a correct diagnosis  (true positive and true negative patients) was increased with  vTS resulting in an increase in neuroimaging. As a con - sequence, we need to perform additional MRIs to detect a  stroke patient which increases costs but this test potentially  reduces the number of diagnostic errors [21]. vTS offered  no additional diagnostic value but could still be helpful for  non-experts, for the standardization and quantification of  measurements.Limitations This is the first large study in which both clinical and quan- titative vertical ocular misalignment were assessed and  compared. Future large-scaled studies with AVS patients  and quantitative skew deviation measurements are needed  to confirm that AUVP does not produce large skews greater  than 3.3 deg. Skew deviation could potentially also occur as a crosstalk  between horizontal and vertical eye movements e.g., due to  imprecise calibration. Other caveats include further potential  test bias such as an incomplete binocular fusion (due to the  dark environment and near target), the monocular recording  and the decompensating phoria as a consequence of sponta- neous nystagmus. Nevertheless, we showed that nystagmus  intensity was not correlated to the grade of skew deviation.  Equally, we also did not test visual acuity with both eyes  which theoretically can lead to eye drifts and deviations on"

This test, however, cannot be used as a stand-alone  test but is rather meant to be used as part of the HINTS  protocol in patients with AVS. Overall, test of skew did  not accurately discriminate AUVP from stroke regardless  whether it was detected clinically or with VOG. Especially  for clinicians lacking specialized training in oculomotor  examination, vTS can help standardize an otherwise diffi- cult exam and perhaps even establish an objective numerical  cut-off in the future. Furthermore, the vTS can serve as a diagnostic tool in  an outpatient setting, when studying disease progression  and compensation. Skew deviation usually resolves after  days and might be used as a clinical sign of compensation  of static vestibular function [22]. In addition, any informa- tion related to ocular alignment plays an important role to  rehabilitation and large skew deviations can be a possible  barrier [1 ]. Conclusions Contrary to prior knowledge, skew deviation proved to be  more prevalent in patients with AVS and occurred in every  forth patient with acute unilateral vestibulopathy. Thus, it  was not necessarily a pathognomonic sign of central disease.  Large skew deviations (> 3.3 deg), however, are a potential  stroke indicator. Clinical and video test of skew offered little  additional diagnostic value in detecting vestibular strokes"

Video test of skew could aid  to quantify skew in the ED setting in which neurotological  expertise is not always readily available.

brodsky 2003,"Skew deviation ....................................................................................... Three dimensions of skew deviation M C Brodsky ................................................................................... Are all skew deviations the clinical expressions of central vestibular dysfunction in three dimensional space ? Skew means set, placed, or running obliquely; slanting.1For a century, skew deviation has been the descriptive term for an acquired vertical deviation that slants the interpupillary axis to an oblique orientation.23This condition has traditionally connoted a severe and debilitating neurological injury within the posterior fossa.4 Subsequent investigation has refined our understanding of this disorder and expanded the boundaries of this diag- nosis.5Working over the past two decades, the promethean team of Brandt and Dieterich have established that skew deviation has a clinical localising value within the posterior fossa67; that it is a component of the ocular tilt reaction (a triad of skew deviation, binocular tor- sion, head tilt)7–9; and that it is asso- ciated with a tilt in the subjective visual vertical.8–11These studies have sup- planted our basic descriptive definitionof skew deviation with a mechanistic understanding of this complex disorder. The underlying mechanism for skew deviation involves a unilateral lesion that inhibits (or occasionally stimulates) central otolithic pathways which run from the medulla to the mesencepha- lon.10 11Since a physiological imbalance in central graviceptive tone is normally produced by a head or body tilt in the roll plane, this lesion producesthe sensation of body tilt and evokes the same stimulus as is evoked by the Bielschowsky head tilt test. 12By activat- ing prenuclear input to the superior rectus and superior oblique muscles of the ipsilateral eye, and the inferior rectus and oblique muscles of the contralateral eye, and by simultaneously inhibiting their antagonists, a cyclover-tical divergence is produced, with intor- sion of the higher eye, extorsion of the lower eye, and a corrective head tilt toward the side of the lower eye. 11This constellation of abnormalities is termedan ocular tilt reaction, which is consid-"
brodsky 2003,"ered to be compensatory for a tilt in thesubjective visual vertical (that is, a perceived tilt of the body relative to the visual environment). 8Thus, even with the head held in its tilted position, thepatient with an ocular tilt reaction perceives it to be upright. 8The beauty of this re-equilibration lies in way thatthe eyes, the interpupillary axis, and head all roll together to conjointly realign to a new orientation that the central vestibular system erroneously interprets as vertical.8Our internal gyroscope so dictates extraocular muscle and postural control at every level! But why should the effects of a central vestibular disturbance confine themselves to a single plane in three dimensional space? It turns out that a lesion involving central otolithic path- ways unilaterally will alter vertical orientation in the roll plane, while a lesion involving central otolithic path- ways bilaterally will alter vertical orien- tation in the pitch plane (corresponding to forward or backward slant).13And if a roll plane imbalance evokes a cyclover- tical divergence of the eyes, what ocular motor signs will a pitch plane imbalance produce? To get an intuitive under- standing of the problem, one has only to observe a slanted vertical object held in the sagittal plane. When viewed alternately with either eye, the same object will appear tilted in opposite directions. This exercise shows that the binocular correlate of tilt is slant.14Given that disconjugate visual tilt is perceived as slant, it is not surprising that a bilateral roll plane lesion should alter vertical orientation in the pitch plane. How the central vestibular system integrates this information is even more fascinating. Brandt and Dieterich have proposed that overlapping pathways modulate roll and pitch function of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.15A tone imbal- ance in the pitch plane indicates bilat- eral paramedian lesions or bilateral dysfunction of the cerebellar flocculus.15 Thus, pathways for roll function canalso mediate pitch function if operating in a bilateral mode, making the most efficient use of the vestibular network. The principle behind this operation in"
brodsky 2003,"physical space resembles the guidance system of an airplane, in which uni-lateral activation of the brake flap causes the plane to roll, whereas bilat- eral activation results in downward pitch. 15In the same way, a unilateral otolithic imbalance produces an oculartilt reaction in the roll plane, while a bilateral injury produces a bilateral ocu- lar tilt reaction, in which the torsionalcomponents cancel each other out but the vertical components summate. 15 We have proposed that this summa- tion can produce a bilateral alternating skew deviation, in which patients exhi-bit an alternating hypertropia of the abducting eye on gaze to either side. 16 17 Because the otolithic pathways corre- sponding to the anterior and posteriorcanals are segregated within the brain-stem, bilateral lesions tend to selectively affect those otolithic pathways corre- sponding to one set of canals. 16A bila- teral lesion causing alternating skew deviation may selectively damage theotolithic pathways corresponding to theanterior canals, thereby activating the posterior canal otolithic pathways (which stimulate the superior oblique and infer-ior rectus muscles bilaterally). 16 17Since the superior oblique muscles are infra- ductors in adduction and extorters inabduction, there is greater infraduction of the adducting eye, producing a pattern of alternating hypertropia of the abduct-ing eye. 16 17Conversely, a bilateral injury to otolithic pathways corresponding to the anterior canals would produce alter-nating hypertropia of the abducting eye. 16 If skew deviation can reflect a roll or pitch imbalance, can other prenuclear injury to the central vestibular pathwayssimilarly alter horizontal alignment of the eyes? The answer is yes. Acquired comitant esotropia can be produced bystructural lesions localised to the poster-ior fossa such as cerebellar vermal tum-ours or Arnold Chiari malformations. 18–21 Since these prenuclear lesions presum-ably affect central vestibular subservinghorizontal rather than vertical vergence,the resulting acquired comitant esotro-pia can be classified as a horizontalskew deviation. Although these cases do not conform to our original descriptive"
brodsky 2003,"definition of skew deviation (requiringan oblique or slanted orientation of thevisual axes), this nosology recognises amechanistic overlap with other forms ofskew deviation (Table 1). The physiological underpinnings of horizontal skew deviation may lie inthe translational vestibulo-ocular reflex.Primates have developed highly specia- lised vestibular mechanisms capable of eliciting robust short latency eyemovements, known as translationalvestibulo-ocular reflexes in responseto linear head movements. 22–25These reflexes optimise binocular gaze stability during linear disturbances.22In any different heading direction, vestibular signals from the otolith organs of theinner ear encode the direction of themovement and transmit that informa- tion to the brainstem, including the moto- neurons innervating the eye muscles. 22 This information is used to generateconjugate version movements (during1440 COMMENTARY www.bjophthalmol.com on June 15, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from  lateral translation) and disconjugate vergence movements (during fore and aft translation) that serve to reduceretinal image slip and provide stableprocessing of the visual surround. 23–25 According to Miles,25these vestibu- larly driven eye movements use radial optic flow and binocular disparity ver- gence to minimise head movement induced modulation of the fixationplane during translation. Visual trackingmechanisms that address translationaldisturbances are most accurately tuned for headings in the fore-aft axis 22(in the surge plane). Disconjugate vergence movements during fore and aft transla-tions exhibit much higher gains (at or above unity) than conjugate version movements during lateral translationin the lateral plane (approximately0.5), suggesting that the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex is tuned to stabi- lise binocular gaze in the same depthplane during translatory movements. 22 Such a vestibularly driven stabilisation of the fixation plane operates at fre-"
brodsky 2003,"quencies higher than those of disparitydriven vergence eye movements andcould be important for the maintenance of stereovision. 22The high gain of the vergence response could be related to the low error threshold for stereovision,which is of the order of seconds of arc. 22 In this way, the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex more closely resembles thesmooth pursuit system (which stabilisesimages on the fovea without regard to peri-pheral vision) than the rotational vesti- bulo-ocular response (which stabilises images only on the peripheral retina). 22 While prenuclear lesions that disrupt vertical vergence localise to the brain stem, those that disrupt horizontalvergence tend to localise to the cerebel-lum. Although little is known about the neural substrate of the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex, monkeys withlesions involving the dorsal cerebellarvermis develop an esotropia that is greater at distance than near fixation. 26 27 The dorsal vermis projects to the fasti- gial oculomotor region, which has beenimplicated in the control of vergence. 27 Neurons have been identified within thecerebellar vermis that modulate withconvergence alone or with convergenceand saccades. 28Humans with global cerebellar dysfunction can have an esophoria during monocular viewingand a smaller esotropia during binocularviewing, suggesting that increased in esotonus to the extraocular muscles with a relatively preserved ability to use hori-zontal disparity cues to drive motorfusion. 29There are theoretical reasons why the cerebellar flocculus may also influence horizontal eye position. In rabbits, the cerebellar flocculus has aninhibitory projection to the medial rectusbut not the lateral rectus muscles, so that a lesion in the flocculus could lead to a convergence bias. 30Some cells in the flocculus discharge in relation to the angle of vergence.31Nevertheless, the selec- tive ocular motor effects of bilateralflocculectomy and paraflocculectomy onhorizontalalignmenthavenotbeendefined. Future study of the perceptual cor- relates of bilateral alternating skew"
brodsky 2003,"deviation and acquired comitant eso-tropia should help to determine whetherthese vertical and horizontal vergence abnormalities indeed reflect central dis- turbances in pitch and surge, andwhether all skew deviations are theclinical expressions of central vestibulardysfunction in three dimensional space.

Vertical diplopia from skew deviation is well described in brainstem lesions. The phenomenon can also result from  peripheral vestibular lesions. During the past years, we have observed these ocular changes in the acute stage following  unilateral vestibular neurectomy and labyrinthectomy (n = 13), as well as in a series of patients suffering from idiopathic  sudden unilateral peripheral vestibular or cochleo-vestibular deficit (n = 5). Diplopia from skew deviation was noted  immediately following ablative vestibular procedures; in patients with idiopathic vestibular deficit, it was observed as an  associated sign. In all patients, clinical evaluation revealed an acute unilateral peripheral vestibular loss, with spontaneous  nystagmus toward the unaffected ear and absence of nystagmic response to caloric testing on the affected ear. Skew  deviation was mesured using the Hess-Weiss test, which is based on the haploscopic principle. Static visual vertical was  evaluated with the original methods of vertical frame and Maddox rod techniques. Photographs were made of the ocular  fundi, to measure the degree of cyclotorsion of both eyes. In our patients. we found skew deviation with hypotropia of"
vibert1996,"the eye that was ipsilateral to the affected ear and conjugated cyclotorsion and tilt of the static visual vertical on the side  of the affected ear. Skew deviation was the first sign to disappear within a few days; conjugated cyclotorsion and tilt of  the static visual vertical persisted for weeks to months. The eye-head postural reaction, consisting of head tilt, conjugated  eye cyclotorsion, skew deviation, and alteration of vertical perception directed toward the side of the lesion. is known as  the Ocular Tilt Reaction (OTR). The mechanism is presumably related to a lesion of the otolithic organs and/or to  changes in the afferent graviceptive pathways. In man, the OTR is often mild and unrecognized, masked by spontaneous  nystagmus and marked neuro-vegetative symptoms. Our ObSerVdtionS indicate that skew deviation, as a part of the OTR,  occurs in patients with sudden peripheral vestibular lesions, whether surgical or non-surgical in origin.  vertical diplopiu, skew cieuiution, oculur tilt reuction, peripherul c~i~hlr.o-L.estihulur loss, vdihulur n  vertical, otolithic ,function.  INTRODUCTION  In human subjects, vertical diplopia from skew devia-  tion is well known in several types of brainstem lesion  (1 -4). During the past few years, however, this phe-  nomenon has also been observed in an acute stage  following unilateral peripheral vestibular surgery,  such as labyrinthectomy or vestibular neurectomy  (5-9) and in an isolated case of stapedectomy ( 10).  In such cases, skew deviation was considered to be  part of the eye-head postural reaction known as the  ocular tilt reaction (OTR).  In the literature on non-surgical peripheral vestibu-  lar dysfunction, only isolated reports of skew devia-  tion have been reported ( 11, 12). We have observed  the phenomenon in several patients following sudden  unilateral peripheral vestibular loss ( 13, 14), so-called  vestibular neuritis ( 15).  In this paper, we report our findings in a series of  patients who developed skew deviation as well as the"
vibert1996,"other manifestations of OTR following either a surgi-  cal or non-surgical unilateral peripheral vestibular  lesion. Skew deviation, abnomalities of the static  visual vertical (SVV), conjugated cyclotorsion and  head tilt were measured with a battery of specially  designed oto-neuro-ophthalmological tests. MATERIAL AND METHODS  Vertical diplopia resulting from skew deviation was  observed in 13 patients suffering from Meniere's dis-  ease (5 men and 8 women, aged from 21 to 64 years)  who were operated on by vestibular neurectomy  (n = 8) or labyrinthectomy (n = 5) between 1993 and  1995 at the University Clinic of ENT, Head and  Neck Surgery, in Berne. Skew deviation was also  observed in 5 patients (3 men and 2 women, aged  from 27 to 71 years) suffering from vestibular neuritis  in 1992 at the Department of Clinical Neurosciences  of the Geneva University Hospital (13) as well as in  a 59-year-old woman with a sudden unilateral periph-  eral cochleo-vestibular loss, evaluated in Berne in  1993 (14). In all these patients, skew deviation and  the other OTR manifestations were measured, and  the results were compared with data from 32 normal  subjects (20 men and 12 women, aged from 7 to 50  years) used as controls.  Skew deviation, and the different manifestations of  OTR, were measured using the following specially  designed oto-neuro-ophthalmological tests:  Meusuremmt ojskew deviation with the Hess- Weiss  test.

A neurological check-up and neuro-radi-  ological examinations (CT, MRI) were also per-  formed.  In surgical patients, static visual vertical measure-  ments were performed before oto-neurological  surgery, a few days after surgery, and several weeks  and months later. In non-surgical patients, measure-  ments were performed a few days or weeks after the  peripheral vestibular loss ( 13). In most patients, mea-  surements were repeated several times at regular in-  tervals during a one-year follow-up."
vibert1996,"RESULTS  In surgical patients, the pre-operative otoneurological  examination showed a symmetrical response to both  caloric and pendular rotatory tests.  In the acute stage after the deficit, all surgical  patients, as well as the patients suffering from an  idiopathic peripheral vestibular deficit, showed the  typical clinical picture of a unilateral peripheral  vestibular loss, with vertigo, neuro-vegetative symp-  toms, spontaneous nystagmus toward the unaffected  ear. and an absence of nystagmic response to caloric  testing on the affected ear. Neurological and neurora-  diological examinations did not indicated any addi-  tional central nervous system disease.  Surgical patients complained of vertical diplopia  immediately after the ablative vestibular procedures.  In the Hess-Weiss test performed within the first few  post-operative days (Table I), a skew deviation, with  hypotropia of the eye ipsilateral to the operated ear,  was shown in cases 6 and 10. In cases 2. 3, and 4,  vertical diplopia was clearly described by the patients.  but measurements of SVV had to be interrupted  because of vomiting. No hypotropia was found in 8  patients. SVV measurements were found tilted to-  ward the operated side by 4 to 20 when evaluated  using the vertical frame, and by 5 to 15 using the  Maddox rod; in the monocular method, the tilt was  greater in the eye ipsilateral to the operated ear.  Ocular fundus photographs showed a conjugated cy-  clotorsion directed toward the operated ear by 4 to  18 in the right eye, and by 2 to 15 in the left eye.  During follow-up, vertical diplopia disappeared  within one to two days, and skew deviation measured  by the Hess-Weiss test also disappeared within 3 days  post-operatively. In contrast, conjugated cyclotorsion  and tilt of the static visual vertical persisted for weeks  to months, with gradual improvement, as shown in  Table I.

In  one patient with sudden peripheral cochleo-vestibular  loss (case 6, Table II), tilt of the SVV remained with  no improvement for up to one year.  In the 32 normal subjects, static visual vertical  measurements showed between f2"" and -2"" of tilt  when evaluated with the vertical frame test, and  between +4"" and -4"" of tilt with the modified  Maddox rod test; positive and negative values indi-  cate right and left deviation, respectively. Ocular  fundus photographs performed in 24 of the normal  subjects showed a slight ( 5 5"") excyclotorsion of both"
vibert1996,"eyes in 19 subjects, and a combinaison of incyclotor-  sion ( I 3"") of the right eye and excyclotorsion ( 5 5"")  of the left eye in 5 subjects.  DISCUSSION  For more than a century, a spectacular eye-head  posture reaction known as the ocular tilt reaction  (OTR), including skew deviation and head tilt toward  the lesion, has been described in animals in the acute  stage after destruction of one vestibular organ  (17, 18). In man, skew deviation is seen mainly in  brainstem lesions (2-4). Since the development of oto-neurological surgery in recent years, this phenom-  enon has also been recognized after vestibular neurec-  tomy and labyrinthectomy (5-8, 19, 20). In such  cases, skew deviation has also been considered as part  of the so-called ocular tilt reaction. This phenomenon  is less marked in man than in animals (Fig. 4).  In our patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular  deafferentation following ablative surgery, vertical  diplopia due to skew deviation was reported immedi-  ately after surgery. The association of this vertical  form of strabismus with the other signs of OTR,  including deviation in the visual vertical, head tilt,  and conjugated cyclotorsion directed toward the op-  erated side corroborated our previous observations  (8, 9) as well as those of other authors (10). Post-op-  eratively, the various signs of OTR disappeared or  decreased progressively in a typical chronological or-  der. Vertical diplopia, as a clinical symptom, was  present only in the first few days after surgery, and  sometimes only for a few hours. Skew deviation  disappears within a few days. In contrast, static visual  tilt and conjugated cyclotorsion persisted for weeks  or months. The Maddox rod test and ocular fundus  photographs showed greater tilt and cyclotorsion in  the eye ipsilateral to the peripheral vestibular lesion.  A comparision of values using the vertical frame test  (binocular method) and the Maddox rod test  (monocular method) showed that results from the"
vibert1996,"former method tended to return more quickly to  normal, suggesting that binocular input might allow a  better compensation. However, other parts of the  Acta Otolaryngol Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by Universitaets- und Landesbibliothek Duesseldorf on 04/07/13 For personal use only.  Acta Otolaryngol (Stockh) 116 Diplopiu and peripheral vestibular lesions 115  central nervous system could also play a role in  subjective vertical perception. Indeed, in one of our  surgical patients (case 9) we found no tilt of SVV,  even though conjugated cyclotorsion was clearly devi-  ated toward the operated ear. In the post-operative  SVV measurement, this patient, who worked as car-  penter, first indicated that his SVV tilted by 8“ to the  side of the operated ear, but, during the same evalua-  tion procedure, was able progressively to reajust the  deviated pointer to the vertical, with a final error of  only 2”. This reajustment of the SVV may have been  made possible by his cognitive knowledge of the  vertical and his perception of angles, as used daily in  his professional activity.  In patients with vestibular neuritis, the symptom of  vertical diplopia and the measured skew deviation, at  the beginning of the clinical picture, initially suggested  a central nervous system lesion. However, the absence  of associated neurological symptoms, and the fact that  an extensive neurological investigation was negative,  favored the hypothesis of the peripheral vestibular  disorder. In the literature, various visual phenomena  have been noted to occur in acute idiopathic unilateral  peripheral vestibular deficit. These include an impres-  sion of rotation, oscillopsia due to spontaneous nys-  tagmus and difficulty in focusing (21). It is possible  that difficulty in focusing was related to an unrecog-  nized ocular tilt phenomenon. Indeed, in our patients  we found a significant tilt of the SVV toward the side  of the affected ear in more than 40% of patients with  a peripheral vestibular or cochleo-vestibular loss (un-  published data). However, because of the delay be-"
vibert1996,"tween the acute phenomenon and the otoneurological  investigation, skew deviation was rarely observed.  After surgical deafferentation, the eye-head pos-  tural changes and the deviation of vertical perception  were observed extending over weeks to months. In  non-surgical patients, the phenomenon was also tran-  sient except in one patient (case 6), in whom cyclotor-  sion and subjective visual tilt perception persisted,  and were almost unchanged one year after the onset  of the acute cochleo-vestibular loss. This distinctive  evolution suggests that central mechanisms of com-  pensation in oculo-vestibular pathways may differ  according to the extension or origin of the peripheral  vestibular lesion in the vestibular organ and/or nerve.  The mechanisms of OTR following peripheral unilat-  eral vestibular lesions are presumably related to a  lesion of the otolith organs and/or to changes in the  afferent graviceptive pathways (6,lO). OTR may of-  ten remain unrecognized in man, and can be masked  by spontaneous nystagmus and marked neuro-vegeta-  tive symptoms.  Our observations indicate that vertical diplopia due  to skew deviation, as part of OTR, may occur in patients with sudden peripheral vestibular lesions of  surgical or non-surgical origin.

ecs15037_1570_1575,"CLINICAL SCIENCES Ability of an Upright-Supine Test to Differentiate Skew DeviationFrom Other Vertical Strabismus Causes Agnes M. F. Wong, MD, PhD, FRCSC; Linda Colpa, OC(C); Manokaraananthan Chandrakumar, HBSc Objective :To determine the sensitivity and specificity of a new upright-supine test to differentiate skew devia-tion from trochlear nerve palsy and other causes of ver-tical strabismus in a large number of patients. Methods :The study consisted of 125 consecutive pa- tients who sought treatment from January 1, 2008, throughDecember 31, 2010, for vertical strabismus of variouscauses: skew deviation (25 patients), trochlear nerve palsy(58 patients), restrictive causes (14 patients), and othercauses (eg, myasthenia gravis and childhood strabismus)(28 patients). Twenty healthy participants served as con-trols. The deviation was measured by the prism and al-ternate cover test using a near target at 1⁄3m in both the upright and supine positions. A vertical strabismus thatdecreased by 50% or more from the upright to supine po- sition constituted a positive test result. Results :The upright-supine test result was positive in 20 of 25 patients with skew deviation (sensitivity,80%)but negative in all patients with trochlear nerve palsy,restrictive, or other causes (specificity,100%). Conclusions :The upright-supine test is highly specific for differentiating skew deviation from other causes ofvertical strabismus. This test could be added as a fourthstep after the 3-step test, and if the result is positive, neu-roimaging should be considered if indicated clinically. Arch Ophthalmol. 2011;129(12):1570-1575 SKEW DEVIATION IS VERTICAL strabismus caused by a su- pranuclear lesion1-9that dis- rupts the vestibulo-ocular re-flex projections from the utricles in the inner ears to ocular motornuclei (ie, the utriculo-ocular reflex). 6,7,10-13"
ecs15037_1570_1575,"It is typically caused by damage to thebrainstem, cerebellum, or peripheral ves-tibular system (ie, the inner ear and its af-ferent projections). 4,7,11,14-17Because the utricles lie roughly in the horizontal planewhen the head is in the upright position,they normally detect static positions (tilts)of the head. In a previous study, 5it has been observed that the magnitude of ver-tical misalignment and ocular torsion inskew deviation is dependent on head po-sition; it decreased substantially when pa-tients changed from an upright to a su-pine position. Conversely, in patients withtrochlear nerve palsy, the vertical strabis-mus and ocular torsion changed mini-mally between these 2 positions. 5On the basis of this observation, we sought to de-vise a simple, new bedside upright-supine test to differentiate skew devia-tion from trochlear nerve palsy and othercauses of vertical strabismus and to de-termine the sensitivity and specificity of this test in a large number of patients. Pre-liminary results were presented in a work-shop and its published proceedings. 18 METHODS STUDY PARTICIPANTS The medical records of all adult ( /H1135018 years of age) and pediatric ( /H1102118 years of age) patients who sought treatment for vertical strabismus atthe University Health Network–Toronto West-ern Hospital, The Hospital for Sick Children, andprivate offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, fromJanuary 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010,were reviewed.

ecs15037_1570_1575,"Twenty-eight patients (10 adults and 18 children) were identified, in-cluding those with myasthenia gravis (2 patients), oculomotornerve palsy (1 patient), strabismus after cataract surgery (1 pa-tient), monocular elevation deficit (1 patient), and vertical stra-bismus that occurred in the context of typical childhood stra-bismus (23 patients; eg, inferior oblique muscle overaction,dissociated vertical deviation, partially accommodative esotro-pia, and intermittent exotropia). The mean (SD) age was 20.9 (21.3) years (range, 4-81 years). Eighteen were female. Twenty healthy individuals (mean [SD] age, 33.9[18.4] years; age range, 4-70 years; 10 female), without any vestibular, neu-rologic, or eye diseases, served as controls. The research pro-tocol was approved by the research ethics boards of the Uni-versity Health Network and The Hospital for Sick Children andadhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. MEASUREMENT OF VERTICAL DEVIATION The magnitude of vertical strabismus was measured by the prismand alternate cover test. While sitting upright with the head erect(participants were not allowed to adopt their usual abnormal headposture, if present), the participant fixated on a single-letter op-totype (12-point font size) located 1⁄3m away in the midsagittal plane at eye level. Prisms of increasing power were placed overthe deviated eye while the cover alternated between the eyes. Thehighest prism strength where no refixation movement occurredwas recorded in prism diopters (PD). The test was repeated withthe participant in a supine position.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The primary outcome measure was the percentage change in de-viation measured from the upright to supine position. The per-centage changes for all 5 groups were compared using analysesof variance. Significant effect was analyzed further using post hocTukey honestly significant difference tests. All statistical analy-ses were performed using the SAS statistical software, version 9.2(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). The significance levelwas set at P/H11021.05. On the basis of the results of a previous study,"
ecs15037_1570_1575,"5a positive up- right-supine test result was defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the vertical deviation measured from the upright to supineposition. Sensitivity of the upright-supine test was calculated by dividing the number of patients with skew deviation who ex-hibited a positive result by the total number of patients with skewdeviation. Specificity was calculated by dividing the number of patients with vertical strabismus other than skew deviation (ie,trochlear nerve palsy, restrictive strabismus, and other causes com-bined) who exhibited a negative result by the total number ofpatients with vertical strabismus other than skew deviation. RESULTS TheFigure shows the percentage change in vertical de- viation from the upright to supine position for each group.A positive percentage change indicated an increase in ver- tical deviation from the upright to supine position, whereasa negative percentage change indicated a decrease in ver- tical deviation from the upright to supine position. Themean (SD) changes in vertical deviation were −63.3% (39.0%) in skew deviation, −2.8%(21.5%) in trochlear nerve palsy, 8.4%(23.0%) in restrictive strabismus, −0.6% (15.5%) in other causes of vertical strabismus, and 0% in healthy controls (analysis of variance, P/H11021.001). Post hoc Tukey honestly significant difference tests revealed thatpatients with skew deviation exhibited a significantly dif-ferent mean percentage change in vertical deviation whencompared with each of the other groups ( P/H11021.001). No significant differences were found among patients withtrochlear nerve palsy, patients with restrictive strabis-mus, patients with other causes of vertical strabismus, andhealthy controls. In patients with skew deviation, the deviation disap- peared completely (ie, 100% decrease) in 9 of 25 patients(36.0%) and decreased 50% or more but less than 100%in 11 of 25 patients (44.0%) when changing from the up-right to supine position. The mean (SD) decrease in ver-tical deviation for these 20 patients with a positive upright-supine test result was −79.1%(22.1%)."

The fifth patient had an alternating skew deviation caused by a pilocyticastrocytoma that involved the cerebellum and medulla bi-laterally. This patient also had gaze-evoked nystagmus, fa-cial nerve palsy, and ataxia. Overall, 20 of 25 patients with skew deviation had a positive upright-supine test result (ie, /H1135050% decrease in the vertical deviation measured from the upright to su-pine position), giving the test a sensitivity of 80%. Allpatients with trochlear nerve palsy, restrictive strabis-mus, or other causes of vertical strabismus had a nega-tive test result, giving the test a specificity of 100%. Allhealthy controls had a negative test result. COMMENT In this investigation, we found that skew deviation is theonly condition in which the vertical misalignment de- creased by at least 50% when the patients changed from an upright to a supine position. All other vertical strabis-mus, including trochlear nerve palsy, restrictive strabis-mus, oculomotor nerve palsy, myasthenia gravis, and ver-tical strabismus that occurred in the context of typicalchildhood strabismus, had a negative upright-supine testresult. However, only 2 patients had myasthenia gravis,which is known to mimic nearly all other ocular motilitydisorders. Therefore, the test may not be 100% specific inall clinical populations. In addition, the study is limitedbecause the examiners were not masked."
ecs15037_1570_1575,"Nevertheless, thehigh specificity of the upright-supine test in the currentseries of patients suggests that this test holds promise asan additional diagnostic step to aid the differentiation ofskew deviation from other causes of vertical strabismus. What is the physiologic basis of this new upright- supine test? Skew deviation has been attributed to an asym-metric disruption of the utriculo-ocular pathway. 6,7,10-13The utriculo-ocular pathway originates from the otolithic re-ceptors of the utricle in the inner ear, which project to thevestibular nuclei. The second-order neurons in the ves-tibular nuclei, in turn, project to the oculomotor and troch-lear nuclei either directly via the brainstem (ie, a disyn-aptic pathway) 22,23or indirectly via the cerebellum (ie, polysynaptic pathways).24,25Hence, skew deviation can oc- cur at a variety of sites where damages cause an imbal-ance in the utriculo-ocular pathway. These damages in-clude lesions in the peripheral vestibular organ or its nerve 2,26-28andcentral lesions within the posterior fossa that involve the vestibular nuclei (eg, in the lateral med-ullary syndrome), 17,29pons,13,30midbrain,15,31-34diencepha- lon,35,36or cerebellum.7,37 Normally, with the head upright, the utricles lie roughly in an earth-horizontal plane. When the head changes froman upright to a supine position during the upright-supine test, the orientation of the utricles changes fromearth-horizontal to earth-vertical. This new orientation ofthe utricles with respect to absolute earth-vertical (grav-ity) may lead to a saturation or reduction in the overallafferent activities of the utriculo-ocular reflex such thatany imbalance of utricular (otolithic) input is mini-mized. This, in turn, may lead to a reduction of verticalmisalignment in skew deviation in the supine position.Conversely, in isolated unilateral peripheral trochlear nerve palsy and other causes of vertical strabismus, the utriculo-ocular pathway remains intact. Thus, the magnitude of ver-tical deviation does not change significantly between theupright and supine positions."
ecs15037_1570_1575,"We observed a few patientswith trochlear nerve palsy who had a larger amount ofchange in vertical deviation between positions (ie, the 4outliers in the Figure) that could not be readily ex-plained. Nevertheless, none of them had a decrease in ver- tical strabismus that was 50% or greater between posi-tions, an observation found exclusively in patients withskew deviation. Therefore, a 50% or greater decrease in ver- tical strabismus between positions appears to be a spe-cific criterion to differentiate skew deviation from all othercauses of vertical strabismus. We found that 5 patients with skew deviation had a negative upright-supine test result. Interestingly, 4 of these5 patients had a lesion affecting the midbrain. We specu-late that their vertical strabismus may have resulted froma combination of skew deviation and nuclear-fasciculartrochlear nerve palsy, which may explain why the upright-supine test result was negative. Clinical differentiation between skew deviation and trochlear nerve palsy is important because the treatmentof patients with these conditions is different. Trochlear nervepalsy is typically diagnosed with the 3-step test. 19In con- trast, the vertical strabismus in skew deviation may be comi-tant or incomitant, and in some cases, it may even bealternating on lateral gaze (ie, bilateral abducting hyper-tropia). 16,31,38It may mimic trochlear nerve palsy during the 3-step test with increased hypertropia on contralat-eral gaze and with ipsilateral head tilt; however, it may alsoincrease on ipsilateral gaze or with contralateral head tilt,or it may remain unchanged with gaze direction or headtilt. 39,40Conversely, a long-standing trochlear nerve palsy with spread of comitance may simulate a comitant skewdeviation. In addition, in both conditions, the head is usu-ally tilted toward the side of the hypotropic eye, althoughthe head tilt in trochlear nerve palsy is a compensatory mechanism to minimize diplopia, whereas that in skewdeviation is part of the pathologic process seen in ocular tilt reaction. 1-4Furthermore, because both conditions may result from brain trauma or from lesions in the posteriorfossa,"
ecs15037_1570_1575,"41differentiating skew deviation from trochlear nerve palsy can be challenging. Fundus examination may be useful to differentiate be- tween the 2 conditions. The fundus is usually excyclo-torted in the hypertropic eye in trochlear nerve palsy, butit is usually incyclotorted in the hypertropic eye (excy-clotorted in the hypotropic eye) in skew deviation. 11,42,43 However, objective assessment of fundus torsion re-quires pupillary dilation and indirect ophthalmoscopy,which may not be readily available or feasible for non-ophthalmologists, including neurologists and orthop-tists. It is also difficult to assess fundus torsion in unco-operative patients. Most patients with skew deviation exhibit other neu- rologic signs that would prompt their physicians to per-form neuroimaging.

In the presentstudy, we encountered 2 patients with acute onset of ver-tical deviation as a result of cerebellar hemorrhage whoexhibited a positive 3-step test result that mimicked a troch-lear nerve palsy, but they had a positive upright-supinetest result that suggested skew deviation. The upright-supine test is thus an additional test that would be usefulto alert physicians to rule out skew deviation even if thepatients have typical features of trochlear nerve palsy. Thetest is simple and quick to perform by covering each eyealternately while patients fixate a near target at 1⁄3m (eg, using a near vision card at patients’ arm length) in boththe upright and supine position, with or without the useof prisms. Unlike fundus torsion, this test does not re-quire pupillary dilation or indirect ophthalmoscopy."

We found the same results whetherthe vertical strabismus measurement was performed withthe whole body or the head only in a supine position. In the present study, we only included patients with neurologic signs to establish an unequivocal diagnosisof skew deviation. It would be interesting to investigatewhether the upright-supine test would be useful in a moreclinically relevant and challenging scenario—one in whicha patient has an isolated vertical strabismus, a positive3-step test result, and an absence of neurologic signs. Aprospective study is currently under way to evaluate theadded value of the upright-supine test beyond the clas-sic 3-step test in this challenging scenario. This prospec-tive study will also investigate the overall sensitivity andspecificity of the combined use of the 3-step test, fundus torsion, and upright-supine test to differentiate skew de-viation from trochlear nerve palsy.

Methods :A middle-aged hypertensive man who had previously suffered stroke with good recovery presented with sudden- onset double vision, slurred speech, ataxia, and a head tilt. Romberg test was positive. The patient denied having"
tudor2016,"disturbances of visual acuity, eye pain, or recent trauma. The right eyeball was pushed upward. The patient complained of double vision in any gaze direction. Movements of the extraocular muscles (EOMs) in the horizontal plane were normal, whereas vertical version and convergence were not possible. We administered a Hess-Lancaster test, cover test, fundoscopic examination, Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test, upright-supine test, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasonography, electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitor (24 h), and echocardiography. Results : The Hess-Lancaster test showed superior rectus muscle and inferior obliquus muscle palsy to the left and rectus inferior muscle and superior obliquus muscle palsy to the right. The right eyeball fell behind when looking downward and the left eyeball when looking upward. Cover alternating test was positive from vertical, R/L. Examination of the ocular fundus showed incyclotorsion of elevated right eye and excyclotorsion of depressed eye. The Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test was negative. A brain MRI with gadolinium revealed a small zone of diffusion restriction in the medial portion of the right cerebral peduncle and right thalamus. There was a gradual improvement in the patient ’s neurological status following treatment. Conclusion : Skew deviation, a not uncommon clinical condition, should be promptly recognized when binocular vertical diplopia cannot be interpreted by trochlearis and oculomotor nerve lesion, myasthenia gravis, or orbital pathology. Maddox rod, cover test, Parks-Bielschowsky three-step, and other tests should help to establish the diagnosis. The prognosis depends on etiology, but it is commonly favorable; the majority of patients recover spontaneously after less than a year. More invasive management options should be discussed thereafter.

Brandt and Dietrich described ipsiversive skew deviation as a localizing sign of a pontomedullary lesion, while con- traversive skew deviation was found to implicate more rostral, pontomesencephalic lesions.2,7–9 In humans, achieving normal oculomotor activity is dependent upon a complex interplay between complex"
tudor2016,"supranuclear circuitry, brainstem nuclei, cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, their respective neuromuscular junc- tions, target muscles, and otolith organs that consist of the utricle and saccule.10The utriculo-ocular re ﬂex is responsible for detection of horizontal head translation and static head tilt. It transmits information to the midbrain, vertically acting ocular motoneurons, as well as to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC). An imbalance of underlying pathways can cause asym- metric reduction of the translational vestibulo-ocular and ocular counter-roll responses and result in skew deviation.11,12Both peripheral and central conditions may present with skew deviation1,2,5,7,13–30(Table 1 ). The most common cause of skew deviation is brain- stem stroke. Additional forms, such as paroxysmal skew deviation (noise induced due to perilymph ﬁs- tula—Tullio phenomenon), alternating skew deviation, and transient neonatal skew have been recognized.7 Classical skew deviation usually occurs as a part of ocular tilt reaction (OTR), a clinical syndrome charac- terized by a complex interplay of perceptual (tilt in subjective vertical), ocular motor (tonic or paroxysmal ocular torsion; and skew deviation), and postural (head tilt) manifestations.7 OTR and skew deviation are usually ipsiversive with peripheral and pontomedullary lesions, and contraversive with pontomesencephalic lesions; i.e., if the brain lesion occurs prior to crossing the path- way, the lower eye will be on the same side as the lesion, and if the lesion is higher in the brain (after pathways crossing), the higher eye will represent the side of the lesion. In thalamus lesions, the tilts of the subjective visual vertical may be contraversive or ipsiversive.7,31By convention, the term hypertropia is used (regardless of the lesion site) to denote the higher eye, regardless of which is at fault. Three different types of skew deviation are described when they occur as a part of OTR: upward deviation"
tudor2016,"of both eyes (lesion site in utricle; e.g., Tullio phe- nomenon due to a subluxated stapes foot plate), hypertropia of one eye (lesion is in the dorsolateral medulla oblongata), and s imultaneous hypertropia of one eye and hypotropia of the other eye (lesion is in the midbrain tegmentum).31The Parks- Bielschowsky three-step test is commonly used to differentiate between these two conditions. The ﬁrst step should determine which eye is hypertropic in the primary position (the uncovered eye moves down as the other is covered). The second step should focus on whether the hypertropia increases on right or left gaze, while the third step serves to determine whether the hypertropia increases on right or left head tilt. For clinical purposes, we further divide it according to eye deviation in each lateral ﬁeld of gaze: comitant (deviation stays the same in each lateral ﬁeld of gaze); incomitant (hyperdeviation increases in one lateral ﬁeld of gaze); and laterally alternating skew deviation (hyperdeviation of the abdu cting eye in each lateral ﬁeld of gaze).5 In some cases, skew deviation can clinically mimic trochlear nerve lesion (especially in the case of lat- erally alternating skew deviation, which can be dif- ﬁcult to distinguish from bilateral fourth nerve lesion), and it could be dif ﬁcult to differentiate between these two conditions. In the ﬁrst case,, other focal neurological signs (astasia, dysarthria, dysmetria) can be present and brain magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) usually reveals a posteriorTABLE 1.

This is usually not the case with uni- l a t e r a lp e r i p h e r a lt r o c h l e a rn e r v ep a l s y .5 Indirect ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal nerve ﬁber layer plots were found to be useful in objectively quantifying the degree of ocular cyclotorsion. While in a trochlear nerve lesion the fundus of the hypertropic eye is excy- clorotated, in skew deviation it is incyclorotated and the fundus of the hypotropic eye is excyclorotated.32In both trochlear nerve lesion and skew deviation, the head is usually tilted contralateral to the side of the hypertropic eye. In the ﬁrst case, this represents a compensatory mechanism (to minimize hypertropia), while, in skew deviation, it re ﬂects an underlying pathologic mechanism where it strives to realign the eyes and head to a tilted position which the brain perceives as vertical.5,7Thus, skew deviation is asso- ciated with a tilt in the subjective visual vertical; i.e., a misconception of vertical."
tudor2016,"3This is a basis of the upright-supine test, which is highly speci ﬁc in differ- entiating skew deviation from other causes of vertical strabismus.33It is thought that, when changing from an upright to a supine position, the orientation of the utricles changes from earth-horizontal to earth –verti- cal, this leads to a saturation or reduction in the overall afferent activities of the utriculo-ocular re ﬂex, mini- mizing any asymmetry of the re ﬂex. This leads to the reduction of torsion and vertical misalignment in skew deviation. The test is considered to be positive if ver- tical deviation decreases by ≥50% from the upright to supine position.5 The ocular tilt reaction and skew deviation usually resolve sponta neously over weeks to months.7As symptomatic relief, an eye patch and prism may be used. Botulinum toxin and surgical correction are usually effective in more resistant, long-term cases.34–36 CASE REPORT A 59-year-old man with a long history of high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia, who previously suffered an ischemic brainstem stroke, presented with sudden onset of diplopia, speech disturbances, and gait impairment (drift to the left). He denied having any changes of visual acuity, eye pain, or recent trauma. Neurological examination revealed dysarthria, and a slightly tilted head towards the left shoulder with low- ering of the chin. The right eyeball was positioned more upwards compared to the somewhat lowered left eye (vertical misalignment –strabismus). It fell behind when the patient was requested to look down- wards and laterally, whereas the left eye fell back- wards when the patient was requested to look upwards and laterally. The patient complained of diplopia in any gaze direction. In the Romberg test,the patient fell to the left side and, while performing a tandem walk, a drift to the left was detected. Movements in the horizontal axis were intact, while the patient could not perform vertical version and convergence. The Hess-Lancaster test showed superior rectus muscle and inferior obliquus muscle palsy on"
tudor2016,"the left and rectus inferior muscle palsy and superior obliquus muscle palsy on the right. The Parks- Bielschowsky three-step test was negative. A cover alternating test was + from vertical, R/L. Examination of the ocular fundus showed incyclotorsion of the ele- vated right eye and excyclotorsion of the depressed eye. An upright-supine test was positive. A brain MRI revealed a small zone of diffusion restriction in the medial portion of the right cerebral peduncle and right thal amus, consistent with impaired posterior cerebral artery irrigation and acute ischemia, as well as diffuse chronic postis- chemic lesions periventricul ar, sub-cortically, and in the brainstem. A previous MRI performed between hospitalizations found only chronic vascular lesions supra and infratentorially. Transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasonography revealed no signi ﬁcant changes in haemodynamics (stenosis/vasospasm), other than diffuse atherosclero- tic changes consistent with age. An electrocardiogram (ECG) as well as Holter monitor (24 h) detected sinus rhythm and showed non-speci ﬁc T-wave abnormalities as well as period- ical arrhythmias with three isolated supraventricular extrasystoles (SVES). The echocardiography did not disclose a cardiac source of emboli. There was a par- tial, gradual improvement in the patient ’s neurological status following treatment. On a regular follow-up visit (two months after hos- pital discharge), the patient did not report any visual disturbances, and OTR recovered spontaneously, with normal neurological examination. DISCUSSION We present a patient who developed sudden-onset OTR: right-sided skew deviation, head tilt to the left shoulder, and tilt of the subjective visual vertical. The Parks three- step test was negative and the upright supine test was positive. One must bear in mind the possibility that OTR mimics, for example, a trochlear nerve lesion when exam- ining patients who present with head tilt and eye vertical misalignment, in which the Parks-Bielschowsky three- step test is usually positive, the fundus of the hypertropic"
tudor2016,"eye excyclorotated, and the upright-supine test is negative.5In our patient, fundoscopy showed incyclotor- sion of the elevated right eye and excyclotorsion of the depressed eye, which corroborates skew deviation as an underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the upright supine test was positive.

Oth er neurological signs (dys- arthria, ataxia) are suggestive of skew deviation as an underlying pathological mechanism of vertical misalignment.5 Finally, symptoms usually resolve spontaneously (over weeks to months), as was the case with the presented patient.7 DECLARATION OF INTEREST The authors report no con ﬂicts of interest with this study.

The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"The Clinical and Imaging Pro ﬁle of Skew Deviation: A Study of 157 Cases Eyal Walter, MD, Jonathan D. Trobe, MD Background: Skew deviation, a vertical misalignment of the eyes caused by a lesion in the vestibulo-ocular pathway, is a common manifestation of brainstem dysfunction, yet comprehensive information about its clinical pro ﬁle is lacking. The aim of this study was to document presenting symptoms, causes, ocular alignment features, accompa- nying neurologic signs, pertinent brain imaging abnormali-ties, and measures used to relieve diplopia.Methods: We searched the electronic medical records text from 2000 to 2018 for “skew ”or“skew deviation ”at a ter- tiary care academic center, including only patients diagnosedunder supervision of faculty neuro-ophthalmologists. Afterexcluding patients with features suggesting an imitator of skew deviation, we collected data useful in answering the selected clinical issues.Results: In a cohort of 157 patients, vertical misalignment ranged between 1 and 30 prism diopters (PD) (median 5 PD) and was comitant in 100 (64%) patients. Diplopia was reported by 87% and blurred vision by 11% of patients.Blurred vision was more common when vertical misalign- ment was less than 3 PD. At least one accompanying neurologic sign was present in 133 (85%) patients, mostoften nystagmus, followed by gaze paresis, ataxia, saccadicpursuit, and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Stroke affecting the thalamus, brainstem, or cerebellum accounted for 82 (52%) of cases. Stroke was usually ischemic, mostlyunprovoked, but also occurring after intracranial or extra-cranial surgical procedures. Brainstem tumor and operative injury caused most of the remaining cases. A subgroup of 17 (11%) patients had skew deviation as the only newclinical sign and had no pertinent brain imaging abnormal- ities. Resolution of skew deviation, documented in 58 (42%) of 137 patients who had at least one follow-up visit, usuallyoccurred within 3 months, but sometimes not until after 12months."
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"Of 110 patients who still had diplopia on follow-up examinations, the diplopia was successfully relieved with prism spectacles in 68 (62%). The cause of the skewdeviation, amount of vertical misalignment, and degree of incomitance did not predict the success in relieving diplo- pia. Accompanying neurologic signs, including ataxia, endured in 44% of patients and were often more debilitating than the diplopia of skew deviation. Conclusions: The amplitude of misalignment in skew deviation varies widely but is generally 5 PD or less. Whenmisalignment is 3 PD or less, patients report blurred vision rather than diplopia. Skew deviation is usually accompanied by other neurologic signs re ﬂecting brainstem dysfunction. Yet there is a small subgroup in which vertical misalignment is an isolated sign, and there are no supporting brain imaging abnormalities. The main cause of skew deviation isischemic stroke, which affects not only the brainstem butalso the thalamus. Diplopia from skew deviation frequently persists, in which case prism spectacles may be successful in palliating it. Accompanying neurologic signs, especiallyataxia, may outlast skew deviation and be more debilitating. Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology 2021;41:69 –76 doi: 10.1097/WNO.0000000000000915© 2020 by North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society Skew deviation is a vertical misalignment of the eyes, or hypertropia, that is part of an abnormal ocular righting reﬂex called the “ocular tilt reaction, ”which includes ocular torsion and head tilt (1,2). It occurs when a lesion upsets the balanced input to the interstitial nuclei of Cajal in the mes- odiencephalic junction. Experimental and clinical lesions of the labyrinth, vestibular nerve, brainstem, cerebellum, and thalamus can produce this phenomenon (3). Common causes are stroke, tumors, and in ﬂammatory demyelination. Patients generally do not notice the head tilt or a deviation in the perceived position of the horizon (“subjective visual vertical ”), reporting only diplopia or"
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"blurred vision resulting from the hypertropia (3). Although many single case reports and a thorough review (3) have documented skew deviation from a variety of causes, there are only 3 reported clinical series. Two of these reports appeared before the era of high-de ﬁnition brain imaging (4,5), and the third was dedicated to the study of ocular torsion (6).Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (EW, JDT), Kellogg Eye Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan;and Departments of Neurology (JDT) and Neurosurgery (JDT),University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

They reported 2 additional caseswith isolated hypertropia and features of a decompensatedsuperior oblique palsy that they considered imitators ofskew deviation. When there are no accompanying neuro- logic abnormalities, they cautioned, the distinction from other causes of hypertropia is dif ﬁcult."
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"Keane (5) described the clinical features of 100 patients with skew deviation who were examined over a 4-yearperiod as inpatients at Los Angeles County Hospital. Diag-nosis was based on clinical features and, in a minority, onautopsy. No brain imaging was reported. In that cohort, 60were judged to have suffered stroke, 14 had posterior fossa tumors, 11 had clinically presumed multiple sclerosis, and the remainder had other diagnoses. Accompanying neuro-logic manifestations were common, especially internuclearophthalmoplegia, horizontal gaze paresis, sixth nerve andseventh nerve palsies, and homonymous hemianopia. Theauthor did not specify how many patients had skew devia-tion as an isolated neurologic manifestation. Based on thepattern of accompanying neurologic abnormalities, skew deviation was localized to all levels of the brainstem and perhaps the cerebellum. Most patients exhibited someimprovement in ocular alignment over time, but no furtherdetails about recovery were provided. In 1993, Brandt and Dieterich (6) reported that 56 (36%) of their 155-patient cohort with imaging-conﬁrmed unilateral brainstem infarction had skew devia- tion. In that study, the authors ’aim was to document the prevalence of ocular torsion and the location of the lesion in relation to the direction of the torsion and the side of thehigher eye. All patients had ocular torsion in at least oneeye, as determined by foveal displacement on fundus photo-graphs, and all demonstrated a tilt of the subjective visualvertical, as measured in an earlier study by having the pa-tients position a line according to their perception of verti-cality in relation to the horizon (7). The authors did not state whether the patients had a head tilt or whether they had reported a tilt of the subjective visual vertical outsidethe experimental setting. Infarcts were distributed through-out the brainstem and thalamus, with skew occurring inthalamic infarction when the lesion extended caudally intothe rostral midbrain. The hypertropic eye was always ipsi-lateral to lesions rostral to the midpons and contralateral tolesions caudal to the midpons. Hypertropia ranged from 2"
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"prism diopters (PD) to 40 PD, averaging 8 PD. Given these reports, there remain several issues worthy of more detailed study: 1) in what setting is the diagnosis ofskew deviation most often made? 2) what symptoms dopatients typically report? 3) what are the features of thehypertropia? 4) how often is skew deviation accompanied byother neurologic manifestations and which ones are mostcommon? 5) what are the causes of skew deviation and how often can these causes be veri ﬁed on brain imaging? 6) how long does skew deviation persist? 7) how long do accom-panying neurologic manifestations persist? and 8) howoften, and under what circumstances, is a spectacle prismsuccessful in relieving the diplopia of skew deviation? In an attempt to answer these questions, we undertook a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with skew deviation by neuro-ophthalmologists at a single tertiary-care academic institution in which adequate documentation wasavailable. METHODS We obtained Institutional Review Board approval fora retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records at the University of Michigan for patients with skew deviation. We de ﬁned skew deviation as an acute onset of vertical misalignment without other plausible cause, using thefollowing exclusion criteria: 1) inadequate ocular alignmentdata, 2) the Parks 3-step test suggesting fourth nerve palsy,3) lack of brain imaging, 4) imaging or clinical evidence ofan orbital abnormality, 5) ptosis present at any encounter,6) positive acetylcholine receptor antibody test or electro- myography suggestive of myasthenia gravis, 7) nonabrupt onset of diplopia, 8) examinations performed withoutsupervision of a University of Michigan faculty neuro-ophthalmologist, and 9) no follow-up visits to document analternative diagnosis when original brain imaging wasnegative. We used the Electronic Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE) of the University of Michigan (8) to search the records of the Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinics from 2000 to 2018 for the terms “skew”and“skew deviation. ”We ob-"

RESULTS Demographics The cohort consisted of 157 patients, among them 81(52%) men and 76 women with an average age of 58 years. Diagnostic Setting Initial diagnosis was made on 102 (65%) outpatients and55 (35%) inpatients or ED patients. Among the 102outpatients, 88 had been referred to the clinics by anophthalmologist (37), unspeci ﬁed provider type (21), neurologist (18), physiatrist (5), primary care physician(5), or neurosurgeon (2). An additional 14 (9%) outpatientswere diagnosed after an earlier hospital admission or ED visit at our institution. Symptoms There were 136 (87%) patients who reported diplopia, 18 (11%) who reported blurred vision, and only 3 (2%) who reported no visual symptoms. Among the 136 patients who reported diplopia, the vertical misalignment averaged 8 PD(median 5 PD), whereas among the 18 patients whoreported blurred vision, the vertical misalignment averagedonly 3 PD (median 2 PD), being larger than 2 PD in theprimary position in only 3 patients. The 3 patients whoreported no visual symptoms had vertical misalignmentaveraging 5 PD, but one patient had pseudophakic monovision and the other 2 patients had reduced visual acuity in one eye. No patient reported a tilt of the visualenvironment, but documentation of whether that symptomwas explored was not available. In 91 (58%) patients, diplopia or blurred vision were"
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"accompanied by nonvisual symptoms, including dizziness(22), imbalance (22), headache (21), weakness (11), slurredspeech (9), nausea (7), numbness (5), extremity weakness (4), oscillopsia (3), drowsiness (2), hearing loss (2), tinnitus (2), facial weakness (2), facial numbness (2), facial pain (1),and visual ﬁeld loss (1). In the 63 (40%) patients who had diplopia or blurred vision as the only recorded new symptoms, 41 (65%) hadan abnormal neurologic examination, including nystagmus(27), vertical or horizontal gaze de ﬁcits (8), internuclearophthalmoplegia (7), ataxia (3), facial weakness (3), slow saccades (2), visual ﬁeld defect (2), dorsal midbrain syndrome (2), Horner syndrome (1), or increased deep tendon re ﬂexes (1). Features of Vertical Ocular Misalignment The vertical ocular misalignment was comitant in 100 (64%) patients and incomitant in 57 (36%) patients. Among the 57 patients with incomitant misalignment, 16patients had hypertropia that reversed from a right hyper- tropia in right gaze to a left hypertropia in left gaze (“alternating skew deviation ”). There were no patients with intermittent ( “paroxysmal ”) skew deviation. Head tilt was not recorded in any patient. The amplitude of vertical misalignment in primary gaze position ranged from 1 to 30 PD with an average of 7 PD and a median of 5 PD. The amount of vertical mis- alignment did not differ substantially according to the cause of skew deviation. Torsional alignment was measured inonly 33 patients. Among them, there were 6 patients withexcyclodeviation (average 4°) and 4 patients with incyclode- viation (average 3°). None of these 10 patients reported perceiving torsional misalignment or a shift in the subjectivevisual vertical, but there was inadequate documentation thatthese symptoms were queried. Binocular torsion was not documented. There was no correlation between the amount of"
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"hypertropia and the frequency of a pertinent imaging abnormality or accompanying neurologic signs. Thus, among the 51 patients with a hypertropia of more than 7PD, 42 (82%) had a pertinent imaging abnormality and 44(86%) had accompanying neurologic signs. Among the 41 patients with hypertropia of 3 PD or less, a pertinent imaging abnormality was seen in 31 (76%) and 38 (93%)had accompanying neurologic signs. Causes Stroke Stroke was imaging-con ﬁrmed in 67 patients and clinically presumed in 15 patients, for a total of 82 (52%) patients. In 13 of these patients, the stroke followed within 24 hours ofa procedure. In 10 of them, the stroke occurred after an extracranial procedure (3 cardiac catheterizations, 3 trans- aortic valve replacements, 1 each of coronary artery bypassgraft, mitral valve surgery, popliteal artery bypass surgery,and cesarean section). In 3 patients, the stroke occurred after an intracranial procedure (1 trans-sphenoidal surgery, 1 meningioma resection, and 1 basilar artery stenting). In the 67 patients with imaging-con ﬁrmed stroke, there was a pertinent lesion in the thalamus (17), pons (16), cerebellum (14), midbrain (12), medulla (9), unspeci ﬁed location within the brainstem (7), or “cerebellopontine angle ”(2). Ten of these patients had lesions in 2 locations that could have accounted for skew deviation.

Among these patients, 62 (93%) had at least oneother neurologic sign, and 47 (70%) had 2 or more otherneurologic signs. The distribution of strokes did not differin the patients with comitant, incomitant, and alternatingskew deviation. In the 15 patients without pertinent imaging abnormal- ities, stroke was clinically presumed in 13 patients on the basis of age, risk factors, and accompanying neurologic manifestations. In the remaining 2 patients, stroke wasclinically presumed because it immediately followed surgeryand could not be explained by direct surgical injury. Tumor There were 15 patients (10%) who developed skew deviation in the setting of a posterior fossa tumor (3metastatic breast cancer, 2 glioblastoma multiforme involv-ing the brainstem, 2 primary central nervous system (CNS)lymphoma, 1 pilocytic astrocytoma, 1 medulloblastoma, 1cavernoma, 1 fourth ventricular cyst, 1 meningioma, 1metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, 1 metastatic lym-phoma, and 1 metastatic urothelial carcinoma). All but 1 patient (primary CNS lymphoma) had neurologic signs in addition to skew deviation. Operative Injury There were 15 patients (10%) who developed skew deviation immediately after intracranial surgery for brainstem orthalamic tumors in which imaging-con ﬁrmed surgical trauma rather than stroke was judged to be the cause of the skewdeviation (3 cavernomas, 2 subependymomas, 2 meningio- mas, and 1 ependymoma, 1 schwannoma, 1 glioblastoma, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 1 pilocytic astrocytoma, and 1medulloblastoma)."
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"Skew deviation immediately followed 2intracranial procedures for nontumorous conditions (removalof an intraventricular shunt and posterior fossa decompres-sion for trigeminal neuralgia). All but 1 patient (pilocyticastrocytoma) had accompanying neurologic signs. Nontumorous Cerebellar Disorders Skew deviation occurred in 10 (6%) patients with non- tumorous cerebellar disorders, including 5 patients withspinocerebellar atrophy, 3 with a paraneoplastic disorder (1anti-GAD 65, 1 anti-Yo, and 1 with metastatic uterinecancer but negative paraneoplastic panel and no lesions onMRI), and 2 with inherited cerebellar degeneration. All 10patients had other neurologic signs, including nystagmus,saccadic pursuit, or ataxia. Eight patients had MRI abnormalities consistent with marked cerebellar volume loss, and 2 had normal MRI scans. Demyelination Skew deviation developed in 7 (4%) patients with MRI abnormalities compatible with brainstem demyelination (5pons, 2 cerebellum, 1 midbrain, and 1 thalamus). Amongthem, 4 had had no previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis at the time of diagnosis of skew deviation. All 7 patients hadaccompanying neurologic signs, including internuclearophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, ataxia, saccadic pursuit, gazeparesis, or increased deep tendon re ﬂexes. Traumatic Brain Injury Skew deviation occurred in 4 (3%) patients after head trauma. All had other neurologic signs, including nystag-mus, quadriplegia, or square wave jerks. Among these 4 patients, 3 had diffuse axonal injury signs on computed tomography (CT) or MRI, and 1 had a normal CT as theonly brain imaging study. Posterior Circulation Aneurysm Skew deviation occurred in 2 (1%) patients with angio- graphically proven brainstem saccular aneurysms with masseffect (1 midbasilar and 1 vertebrobasilar junction). Bothhad other neurologic signs, including sixth nerve palsy,"
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"facial hypesthesia, ataxia, or nystagmus. Miscellaneous Causes Miscellaneous causes accounted for 5 cases of skew deviation (1 Chiari malformation, 1 brainstem encephalitis,1 neurosarcoidosis, 1 Parkinson disease, and 1 autoimmuneencephalomyelitis). All 5 patients had other neurologicsigns, and 2 (Chiari malformation and neurosarcoidosis)had a pertinent imaging abnormality. Undetermined Cause Skew deviation without accompanying neurologic signs or supportive imaging abnormalities was diagnosed in 17(11%) patients on 2 separate clinic visits at least 3 monthsapart. In this group, hypertropia averaged 6 PD (range 2 –16 PD, median 5 PD). Accompanying Neurologic Signs Among the 157 patients, 133 (85%) had at least one otherneurologic sign besides skew deviation, with 81 (52%)having 2 or more neurologic signs (Table 1). These signsincluded nystagmus in 63 patients (gaze-evoked horizontal jerk in 16, torsional in 10, upbeat in 6, downbeat in 5, convergence retraction in 2, Bruns type in 1, mixed in 9,and unspeci ﬁed in 14), gaze or ductional de ﬁcits in 34 (vertical gaze paresis or palsy in 18, horizontal gaze paresisor palsy in 6, complete gaze palsy in 2, and abduction de ﬁcit in 8), ataxia in 24 (affecting gait in 4, speech in 2, appen-dicular movement in 3, trunk in 1, mixed in 1, and unspec-iﬁed in 14), saccadic pursuit in 23, and internuclear ophthalmoplegia in 18 (bilateral in 3).

Of the 10 patients with a cerebellar disorder as thecause of skew deviation, all but 2 had an abnormal MRI. Ofthe 4 patients with traumatic brain injury as the cause ofskew deviation, 1 had diffuse axonal injury evident on MRI, 2 had a diffuse axonal injury evident on CT, and 1 hada normal CT. Resolution of Skew Deviation At least one follow-up visit was recorded in 137 patients,with an interval to last follow-up visit ranging between0.25 and 132 months (average 14 months, median 4.5months) (Tables 2 and 3). Resolution of skew was docu-mented in 58 (42%) patients, one of whom needed eyemuscle surgery to produce it. The likelihood of spontane-ous resolution of skew deviati on varied greatly according to its cause (Table 2). It was most likely to resolve in demyelination (86%), less often in undetermined causes (59%), traumatic brain injury (50%), post-operativeinjury (40%), and stroke (39%), rarely in brainstem tumor(13%), and not at all in posterior circulation aneurysmsand nontumorous cerebellar disorders. Resolution of skew deviation occurred within 3 months in 33 patients, between 3 and 6 months in 7, between 6 and12 months in 6, and after 12 months in 12 (Table 3). Resolution of Accompanying Neurologic Signs Among 137 patients with at le ast one follow-up visit, 120 patients had accompanying neurologic signs at the initialvisit (Tables 2 and 3). Accompanying signs had partially resolved in 37 (31%) patients and completely resolved in 31 (26%) of these patients by the last follow-up examina-tion, leaving 52 (43%) of the cohort with persistentaccompanying neurologic signs."
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"When resolution ofaccompanying neurologic occurred, it did so within 3months of diagnosis in 27 patients, between 3 and 6months in 10 patients, between 6 and 12 months in 8patients, and after more than 12 months in 23 patients. Thus, accompanying neurolo gic signs generally lingered longer than did skew deviation. Among these signs wasataxia, which was often more debilitating than the diplopia(Table 3). As with skew deviation, the likelihood of recovery of accompanying neurologic signs varied according to theircause. Partial or complete resolution occurred most often indemyelination (86%), less often in tumor (53%), stroke (52%), aneurysm (50%), and operative injury (33%), rarely in nontumorous cerebellar disorders (10%), and not at all intraumatic brain injury. Among the 17 patients with skewdeviation of undetermined origin, 7 (41%) had failed toresolve at the last follow-up visit (Table 2). Measures to Relieve Diplopia Of the 110 patients who still had diplopia on follow-upexaminations, prism spectacles successfully relieved diplopiain 68 (62%).

Thus, among the 68 patients in whom prism spectacles relieved diplopia, the primary gaze positionhypertropia averaged 5 PD (range 1 PD –30 PD, median 3 PD). In that group, 47 (69%) had a comitant hypertropia and 21 (31%) had an incomitant hypertropia, including 5patients who had a right hypertropia on right gaze and a lefthypertropia on left gaze. Among the 42 patients in whomprism spectacles did not relieve diplopia, the average pri-mary gaze position hypertropia averaged 6 PD (range 1 –30 PD, median 4 PD). In that group, 24 (57%) had a comitantdeviation and 18 (43%) had an incomitant deviation, including 8 patients who had a right hypertropia on right gaze and a left hypertropia on left gaze. In the 42 patients in whom prism glasses did not relieve diplopia, 2 had diplopia relieved with an opaque contact lensin 1 eye, and 6 had diplopia relieved by eye muscle surgery (1surgery for 5 patients and 3 surgeries for 1 patient).DISCUSSION This reported series on patients with skew deviation, thelargest to date, con ﬁrms and further quantitates clinical impressions derived from smaller reported series (4,5) andadds some valuable new information. Based on this and earlier studies, skew deviation is usually embedded in a complex of neurologic manifesta- tions re ﬂecting dysfunction at any level of the brainstem, as well as the thalamus. At least one other neurologic sign accompanied skew deviation in 85% of our cohort."
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"Nystagmus was most common, appearing in nearly half ofthe cohort. Gaze paresis, saccadic pursuit, and internuclear ophthalmoplegia were other common neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities, as noted in an earlier series (5).

Stroke accounted for half of causes, with lesions distributed throughout the brainstem, cerebellum, and thalamus. The thalamus emerged as the most common siteof stroke, a ﬁnding that has not been emphasized. Although brain imaging could not verify the full extent of thethalamic lesion, it probably reached into the rostraltermination of the pathway mediating vertical ocularalignment. As suggested by Keane (5) in the preimagingera, strokes proved to be more often ischemic than hemor- rhagic. Although most were unprovoked, an important"
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"number immediately followed intracranial and extracranialprocedures, including heart catheterization, heart valve sur-gery, and bypass grafting, as well as popliteal artery bypasssurgery, and even cesarean section. Brainstem stroke inthese settings is a known phenomenon, perhaps becauseof autonomic dysregulation or emboli (9). Notably, therewere 9 patients in our study with a strong clinical presump- tion of a provoked brainstem stroke in whom MRI was negative. Even high-de ﬁnition brain MRI does not always detect stroke in the brainstem (10). Aside from stroke, brainstem tumor and operative injury were common causes. Demyelination, traumatic braininjury, posterior circulation aneurysms, and miscellaneouscauses accounted a much smaller proportion of cases. An important subgroup of our cohort consisted of 24 patients with skew deviation who had no accompanying neurologic manifestations. In that group, sometimes called“ambulatory skew deviation, ”only 7 patients had pertinent brain imaging abnormalities, leaving 17 with neither imag-ing nor clinically supportive information toward a diagnosis.CT was the only study in 6 of them; MRI might havedetected the lesion. In the 11 patient studies with MRI,we surmise that skew deviation might have been caused by a brainstem stroke too small to be detected even on MRI (10). In this study, the pattern of ocular misalignment was incomitant in 1/3 of cases. Within that group, 1/3 showedreversal of the hypertropia with lateral gaze ( “alternating skew deviation ”). Although these phenomena have been well described, this report provides the ﬁrst quantitation of their relative prevalence in a large group of patients. Previous reports have mentioned that the hypertropia of skew deviation may show improvement over time, but nospeciﬁc details have been provided, probably because of lack of follow-up. In this study, with a median follow-up intervalof 4.5 months, spontaneous resolution of hypertropia anddiplopia was observed in fewer than 50% of patients,varying widely according to cause (Table 2). If skew devi-ation was of undetermined origin, it had a slightly better than 50% chance of disappearing."
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"Among all causes of skew deviation, recovery usually occurred within the ﬁrst 3 months but was often delayed for longer than 12 months(Table 3). The frequently accompanying neurologic signs often proved to be more debilitating and enduring than the skew deviation. Improvement was noted in only slightly morethan half of the cohort. When improvement did occur, itwas often delayed 12 months or more. We acknowledgethat follow-up was incomplete and that patients may nothave returned because they had recovered or sought careelsewhere. A critical ﬁnding in this study was that 62% of the patients with enduring diplopia could have it relieved with spectacle prisms. Surprisingly, neither the cause of the skew,the size of the hypertropia, nor the degree of incomitancepredicted success in relieving diplopia. Surprisingly, diplo-pia associated with large hypertropia could sometimes bepalliated with spectacle prisms, suggesting that somepatients may be reporting relief of diplopia even whenocular misalignment persists. This study further delineates the clinical and imaging proﬁle of skew deviation. Its strengths are a large patient cohort with adequate clinical documentation con ﬁrmed on examination by neuro-ophthalmologists, strict exclusioncriteria to avoid inclusion of clinical imitators of skewdeviation, high prevalence of high-de ﬁnition neuroimaging, and a search engine capable of detecting any mention ofskew deviation in electronic medical record text. But there are also weaknesses inherent in such a retro- spective study. Examination techniques were performed by 3 different neuro-ophthalmologists in a nonstandard fash-ion, often generating incomplete data. Symptoms ofalteration in the subjective visual vertical were not elicited,and measurements of postural differences in hypertropia,ocular torsion, and a disturbed visual vertical were not oftenperformed. Acknowledging these study strengths and weaknesses, the relevant conclusions from this study are as follows: 1) Most patients with skew deviation will report a visual disturbance —usually diplopia, but if the hypertropia is less than 3 PD, they may describe blurred vision. 2) The hypertropia of skew deviation will be incomitant in an important minority of cases; within that subgroup,the hypertropia often reverses in gaze from side to side(“alternating skew deviation ”)."
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"3) Skew deviation is usually accompanied by other neurologic manifestations, especially nystagmus, saccadic pursuit, hor- izontal gaze paresis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, andataxia; such accompanying signs, often subtle, are impor-tant in distinguishing skew deviation from other causes ofacute hypertropia, especially if visual symptoms are isolatedor most prominent.

The important management implications of this pro ﬁle are the following: 1) Attention must be paid to detection of accompanying neurologic features, which are common and critical for diagnosis."
The_Clinical_and_Imaging_Profile_of_Skew.12,"2) In the small proportion of cases where acute hypertropia is the only clinical abnormality and high-de ﬁnition brain imaging is negative, the diagnosis of skew deviation is viable but must be questioned. 3) Patients should be advised that skew deviation may last for months or even inde ﬁnitely, and that accompanying neurologic manifestations, especially ataxia, may be more debilitating.4) Prism spectacles may alleviate diplopia even when the misalignment is greater than 3 PD and incomitant;when that intervention fails, eye muscle surgery maybe effective in relieving diplopia.

We present a novel and highly instructive case of a patient with acutevertigo and binocular diplopia from a large skew deviation due to vestibular neuritis. As the case unfolds,text and video commentary guide the clinician through the important elements of the history, bedsideexamination, and laboratory evaluation necessary for accurate diagnosis in the acute vestibular syndrome.We demonstrate how to interpret nystagmus and properly perform the head impulse test and test of skew deviation and discuss the pitfalls of overreliance on imaging when evaluating patients with acute vertigo. ª2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Onset of vertigo during a migraine sug- gests a ﬁrst episode of vestibular migraine as a possible etiology. Vestibular migraine is the most common cause of recurrent spontaneous (nonpositional) episodes of vertigo, andvestibular symptoms usually develop years af-ter other migraine symptoms. Most episodesresolve within 72 hours. Diplopia"
eggers2020,"The patient noted binocular vertical diplopia butno hearing loss, neck pain, dysarthria, dysphagia,facial weakness, limb incoordination, or sensorysymptoms. Possible lesion localization in patients with vertigo involves the vestibular periphery, brain stem, and cerebellum. Diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria, or dysmetria (the “dangerous Ds ”)point toward central localization, while hear- ing loss can have a central or peripheral cause. Patients with acute vertigo at the height of their symptoms are very distressed withnausea and vomiting and often ignore theseassociated symptoms. In this case, binocularvertical diplopia with an acute vestibular syn-drome (AVS) is a red ﬂag against peripheral and for central localization that requiresfurther investigation. Imaging The patient was admitted to a local hospital after head computed tomography (CT) and head/neckCT angiography yielded normal ﬁndings in the emergency department. Head magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging(DWI), performed less than 24 hours from vertigoonset, also identi ﬁed no abnormalities and no ev- idence of acute ischemia, demyelination, or vestib- ular nerve abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging with DWI and apparent diffusion coef ﬁcient is the crite- rion standard that de ﬁnes an acute stroke. However, MRI performed too early in poste-rior fossa ischemia occasionally fails to detectrestricted diffusion.

Compelling central clinical signs (including the triad of ocular motor signs that will be described subsequently) requirefollow-up MRI, ideally obtained more than48 hours after symptom onset, and carefulclinical monitoring. Nystagmus Over 4 days, the patient was managed symptom-atically with intravenous hydration and anti- emetics. Vertigo and nausea resolved, although she could still induce brief dizziness with quickhead turns. Gait and balance were improving.However, she was still squinting because ofdiplopia. She was discharged on day 5 with atreatment regimen of prednisone, 60 mg daily. When evaluated in the otoneurology clinic the following day, results of a general neurologic ex- amination were normal except for a moderately cautious, wide-based gait with tandem gaitimpairment. During Romberg testing, she listedto the left without falling. Hearing was normaltoﬁnger rub. Pupils, fundi, and extraocular range were normal. On direct examination and withvideo oculography during visual ﬁxation, sponta- neous right-beating nystagmus with a small torsional component (top pole of the eyes beating toward the right ear) was present in straight-ahead gaze, increased in rightward gaze, and dis-appeared in leftward gaze. With ﬁxation removed, the right-beating nystagmus intensi ﬁed and became present even in leftward gaze(Supplemental Video 1 , available online at http://www.mcpiqojournal.org ). Saccades were normal, without saccadic lateropulsion or gaze lateropulsion under closed eyelids(a frequent ﬁnding in lateral medullary syn- drome). The right-beating nystagmus intrudedinto rightward and vertical smooth pursuit. This patient ’s examination revealed alter- ations of the vestibulospinal re ﬂex and the vestibulo-ocular re ﬂex (VOR). She could stand and walk but had abnormal posture with Romberg testing and a wide-based gait.Nystagmus direction may help differentiatecentral vs peripheral causes of vertigo."
eggers2020,"Hori-zontal nystagmus that changes direction withchanging gaze positions, upbeat or downbeatnystagmus, and purely torsional nystagmusare associated with central lesions. 1In this pa- tient, the nystagmus was right-beating in straight-ahead gaze, did not change directionwith lateral gaze, increased intensity withblocking ﬁxation, and had only a mild torsional component. This nystagmus pattern is typically observed in patients with periph-eral lesions but may also occur with central le-sions. Therefore, additional clinical signs mustbe sought. Vestibulo-ocular Re ﬂex Testing A head impulse test (HIT) revealed catch-up sac- cades for the left horizontal and occasionally left anterior semicircular canals (SCCs) (Supplemental Video 2 , available online at http://www.mcpiqojournal.org ). The HIT is necessary to identify the pre- cise lesion site. The examiner rotates the pa-tient ’s head quickly by a small amount t o w a r dt h es i d et ob et e s t e d ,o b s e r v i n g whether the patient can effectively use the VOR to maintain visual ﬁxation on a target or whether a “catch-up ”saccade is required to reﬁxate the target once the head stops. A normal HIT result in a patient with AVS ver- iﬁes the integrity of the 3-neuron VOR arc and thus suggests central localization, as is seen with posterior inferior cerebellar artery strokes. In contrast, lesions of the vestibular nerve or labyrinth impair the VOR and pro-duce an abnormal HIT result. In this case, unidirectional horizontal nystagmus beatingaway from the side with an abnormal HITresult points to a peripheral vestibulopathy,most commonly vestibular neuritis (VN).However, the possibility of an anterior infe- rior cerebellar artery (AICA) stroke remains. The internal auditory artery, a branch of theAICA, supplies the inner ear. Accordingly,AICA infarcts may involve the labyrinth andpresent like an acute peripheral vestibulop-athy, typically accompanied by hearing lossfrom cochlear infarction."
eggers2020,"Thus, the bedsideexamination should include assessment for acute hearing loss. So far in this case, with peripheral-appearing nystagmus and HITresult and normal hearing, the next step isto test for skew deviation. Skew Deviation The patient had a prominent leftward head tiltand right hypertropia, preferentially ﬁxating with the left eye, as demonstrated with cover testing (Supplemental Video 3 , available online athttp://www.mcpiqojournal.org ). Maddox rod testing revealed the hypertropia to be comitant,MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS: INNOVATIONS, QUALITY & OUTCOMES 2 Mayo Clin Proc Inn Qual Out nXXX 2020; nn(n):1-7 nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2019.12.003 www.mcpiqojournal.org and results of a Bielschowsky 3-step test did not suggest a trochlear nerve palsy. In normal individuals, tilting the head laterally activates the utricle driving theotolith-ocular re ﬂex, a mechanism to main- tain a gravitationally upright visual axis bygenerating a compensatory ocular counterrollin the opposite direction. 2The resulting torsional eye movements are conjugate, whereas the vertical movements are slightly disconjugate. Under pathologic conditions involving the peripheral labyrinth or central utricular-ocularpathways, the resulting internal misperceptionof verticality may produce a partial or fullocular tilt reaction (OTR) in an attempt torealign the patient with the erroneously computed vertical. 3,4The OTR is a triad of head tilt, ocular torsion in the same directionas the head tilt, and skew deviation with thelower eye on the side of the head tilt(Figure 1 ). Skew is a prenuclear vertical ocular misalignment that is usually comitant (the de-gree of misalignment does not change indifferent gaze positions as it does with an extraocular muscle weakness from an acute cranial nerve palsy) and represents an“otolithic pathway ”cause of diplopia. In a pa- tient with an AVS, skew is the most likelycause of vertical diplopia."
eggers2020,"The magnitude of skew deviation and head tilt are important. Small-amplitudeskew detected by cover testing may rarely occur in VN, but a large skew deviation in a patient with AVS, such as the one seen inthis patient, is much more frequent in acutestroke and represents a red ﬂag requiring further investigation. Clinical Diagnosis Because of the large persisting skew deviation, a second head MRI was performed on day 8. The results were also normal, and acute left VN wasdiagnosed. Vestibular Testing Within 2 weeks of symptom onset, diplopia, dizzi-ness, and unsteadiness completely resolved. Quickhead movements would sometimes cause the pa-tient ’s vision to take a moment to catch up. Sub- sequent vestibular evaluation con ﬁrmed a left peripheral vestibulopathy. Warm caloric re ﬂex testing produced 61 /C14/s right-beating nystagmuswhen irrigating the right ear but no response from the left ear. Video HIT of the horizontalSCC revealed a gain of 0.87 on the right but0.51 on the left, with overt and covert catch-upsaccades (Figure 2 ).Gain was also reduced for the left anterior but not the posterior canal. Cer-vical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials(VEMPs) were normal and symmetric. Ocular VEMPs of 97 dB nHL were present bilaterally at 500 Hz, but the P1 to N1 amplitude on theleft was less than half that on the right .Audiom- etry yielded normal results. FIGURE 1.

The roleof video-oculography recording of the HITcannot be overemphasized, as it provides both multicanal VOR assessment and quanti ﬁ- cation of VOR gain and catch-up saccades. Results of the ocular VEMP, a test of utric- ular function, were abnormal on the left, whileresults of the cervical VEMP, a test of saccularfunction, were normal. Such utricular pathwaydysfunction could both explain the patient ’s OTR and support localization to the SVN. 5 Normal audiographic results are expected inVN and argue against Ménière disease or bac-terial labyrinthitis. Most strokes do not causehearing loss, although AICA strokes may cause cochlear infarction. Outcome Examination 2 months after onset revealed steady"

The HIT continued to showcatch-up saccades for the left horizontal canal.There was a slight leftward head tilt. Alternate cover testing revealed no vertical ocular misalign- ment, and prism testing identi ﬁed less than 1 diopter of right hyperdeviation.

Video head impulse test (vHIT). Horizontal vHIT tracing using video-oculography shows abnormalities with head rotation on the left only. We compare eye velocity from several impulses to head velocity in the opposite direction over time. Overt catch-up saccades, occurring after the head stops, would be clinically evident with the bedside head impulse test without video-oculography.However, vHIT also demonstrates how catch-up saccades sometimes occur during the head impulse. These covert saccades are buried in the vestibulo-ocular re ﬂex and would not be visible to the examiner without vHIT. The tracing also shows the reduced gain (ratio of eye velocity to head velocity) of the left horizontal vestibulo-ocular re ﬂex.MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS: INNOVATIONS, QUALITY & OUTCOMES 4 Mayo Clin Proc Inn Qual Out nXXX 2020; nn(n):1-7 nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2019.12.003 www.mcpiqojournal.org were normal.

eggers2020,"horizontal canal gain to 0.64, but left warm caloric response was still absent. Normal MRIs, vestibular evaluation, and the clinical course con ﬁrmed the diagnosis of VN despite the red ﬂag of a pronounced head tilt and large skew deviation. Throughvestibular compensation, the patient ’s symp- toms resolved except with quick head move- ments that challenge the high-frequency VOR. When examined long after acute vertigohas resolved, provocative maneuvers such asheadshaking and vibration, with visual ﬁxa- tion blocked, may bring out diagnosticallyimportant nystagmus effectively suppressedwith visual ﬁxation. DISCUSSION This case illustrates the frequent diagnostic challenges in patients with vertigo. The bestapproach starts with characterizing the vestib-ular syndrome by considering the timing andtriggers and performing a targeted examina-tion. 6Although benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibulardisorder, it causes brief ( <1 minute) episodes of vertigo and nystagmus triggered by position changes or positional testing. In this case, spon-taneous nystagmus in the upright position withconstant symptoms makes BPPV highly un-likely, although the horizontal canal BPPVvariant can occasionally cause “pseudosponta- neous ”nystagmus that should be suspected if the nystagmus reverses direction when the head is pitched forward 60 degrees. The ﬁrst attack of an episodic disorder such as vestibularmigraine was initially possible (and could pro-duce nystagmus that appears central or periph-eral) but became unlikely because vestibularsymptoms and signs persisted for days. In patients with AVS who lack obvious central nervous system features, a test for 3 ocular motor signs dhead impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) dis highly sensitive for distinguishing centralcauses such as stroke from peripheral causessuch as VN. 7,8A normal HIT result or the presence of spontaneous nystagmus that isdirection-changing, vertical, or purelytorsional are unequivocal central signs. Skew deviation on cover testing is also very sugges- tive of a central lesion ( Table ). A large skew"

The HINTS battery should be applied to patients with an acute vestibular syndrome of acute constant dizziness, vertigo, or ataxia who lack other obvious central neurologic signs on examination. It is no t to be applied to patients who experience only position-triggered vertigo or to those who are no longer symptomatic.SKEW IN VESTIBULAR NEURITIS Mayo Clin Proc Inn Qual Out nXXX 2020; nn(n):1-7 nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2019.12.003 www.mcpiqojournal.org5 VN, and an OTR with prominent head tilt as seen in this patient has not previously been re- ported in VN nor found in a personal series ofmore than 100 VN patients (J.C.K., unpub-lished data, 2019). 7,9,10Acute hearing loss in"
eggers2020,"AVS (which this patient did not have) also ap-pears more common with central than withperipheral causes due to AICA infarcts, mak-ing hearing assessment an important examina- tion component. 8,11 So far, the simple HINTS Plus battery (adding hearing assessment) appears to be su-perior to early MRI for detecting stroke in AVSin the hands of expert examiners. 7,12Although this approach has been widely adopted byvestibular specialists, HINTS has not becomepart of the standard examination of patients with acute dizziness used by most physicians. This difference is likely due in part to physi-cians ’generally poor understanding of the vestibular and ocular motor systems and theinterpretation of their subtle examinationsigns. 13Textbooks and training curricula perpetuate incorrect information. The resultis that patients with acute dizziness who have benign conditions are overevaluated while those with dangerous conditions maybe underevaluated. Ultimately, the likelihoodof vertigo being precisely diagnosed correctlyis similar to a coin ﬂip. 14,15Implementation of HINTS in a large multicenter clinical trialusing video-oculography eguided rapid triage will provide critical answers about its potential to improve diagnosis and initial management by nonexpert clinicians and reduce unneces-sary or unhelpful neuroimaging in patientswith acute dizziness. 16 CONCLUSION Patients with acute constant vertigo and diplopia present a diagnostic challenge that re-quires a careful bedside examination to distin-guish benign from potentially life-threateningcauses. Imaging with CT has little value, andeven MRI with DWI may miss small strokesif performed too soon. When overt centralneurologic signs are absent, the clinician must perform and correctly interpret results of the HIT, characterize the nystagmus, andtest for skew deviation as well as assess foracute hearing loss (the HINTS Plusexamination). Although this examination bat- tery has very high sensitivity and speci ﬁcity in AVS in expert hands, this case illustrateshow on rare occasions a large skew deviationcan result from a peripheral vestibulopathyaffecting the otolith-ocular pathways. Ongoingresearch aims to improve diagnostic accuracyby nonexpert clinicians through both medicaleducation and use of new technologies."

Raymond Buncic, MD, FRCSC; Agnes M. F. Wong, MD, PhD, FRCSC Objectives :To investigate whether ocular torsion and vertical misalignment differ in the upright vs supine po-sition in skew deviation and to compare these findingswith those in trochlear nerve palsy. Methods :Ten patients with skew deviation, 14 pa- tients with unilateral peripheral trochlear nerve palsy, and12 healthy subjects were prospectively recruited. Withsubjects first in the upright position and then in the su-pine position, ocular torsion was measured by doubleMaddox rods and vertical misalignment was measuredby the prism and alternate cover test. Results :In patients with skew deviation, the abnormal torsion and vertical misalignment in the upright posi-tion decreased substantially with change to the supineposition, whereas in patients with trochlear nerve palsy,it changed little between positions. Torsion was de- creased by 83% in patients with skew deviation, 2% inpatients with trochlear nerve palsy, and 6% in healthysubjects ( P/H11021.001). Similarly, vertical misalignment was decreased by 74% in patients with skew deviation andincreased by 5% in patients with trochlear nerve palsyand 6% in healthy subjects ( P/H11021.001). Conclusions :Our findings provide the basis for addi- tional clinical tests to support the classic 3-step test: ocu-lar torsion and vertical misalignment that decrease fromthe upright position to the supine position indicate skewdeviation, whereas torsion and vertical misalignment thatdo not change significantly between positions indicatetrochlear nerve palsy.

ecs80017_899_905,"cally caused by damage to the brainstemtegmentum or cerebellum or by acute pe-ripheral vestibulopathy. 4-10Skew devia- tion has been attributed to an imbalanceof the vestibulo-ocular reflex projections from the utricles in the inner ears to ocu- lar motoneurons (ie, the utriculo-ocularreflex); however, direct evidence for this is lacking. The utricles lie roughly in thehorizontal plane, and they normally de-tect static positions (tilts) of the head. Wepostulate that if skew deviation is causedby an imbalance of the utriculo-ocular re-flex, the abnormal torsion and vertical mis-alignment might be head position depen-dent. The purposes of this study were toinvestigate whether ocular torsion and ver- tical misalignment differ in the upright vssupine position in patients with skew de-viation and to compare these findings withthose in patients with unilateral periph-eral trochlear nerve palsy. METHODS Ten patients with skew deviation and 14 with unilateral peripheral trochlear nerve palsy wererecruited. A complete history was taken anddetailed ophthalmic and neurologic examina-tions were performed. When indicated, appro-priate tests were performed to rule out myas-thenia gravis, thyroid ophthalmopathy, or otherorbital diseases. Magnetic resonance imageswith gadolinium enhancement and slice thick-ness of at least 5 mm were obtained in all ofthe patients. In this investigation, skew deviation was di- agnosed as follows: (1) a vertical misalign-ment (with or without head tilt or fundus tor-sion), the pattern of which is inconsistent withthat found in palsy of 1 or more cycloverticalmuscles; (2) lesions in the posterior fossa de-tected by magnetic resonance imaging; and(3) neurologic symptoms and signs (al-For editorial comment see page 992 Author Affiliations: Department of Ophthalmologyand Vision Sciences,The Hospital for Sick Children(Drs Parulekar, Dai, Buncic, andWong), Department ofOphthalmology and VisionSciences, University of Toronto(Drs Buncic and Wong), andDepartment of Ophthalmology ,University Health Network(Dr Wong),Toronto, Ontario, Canada."

Patients with acute peripheralvestibulopathy were not included because we do not encoun-ter these patients in our neuro-ophthalmology practice. Unilateral peripheral trochlear nerve palsy was diagnosed as follows 11-13: (1) deficient depression of the hypertropic eye in adduction; (2) incomitant hypertropia that increased withadduction of the hypertropic eye and with head tilt toward thehypertropic eye; (3) presence of objective or subjective excy-clodeviation, ie, torsional diplopia; (4) absence of any neuro-logic symptoms and signs suggestive of lesions in the troch-lear nucleus or fascicle; and (5) negative magnetic resonanceimaging results. Exclusion criteria were the following: (1) his-tory of diplopia or strabismus dating to infancy or early child-hood; (2) prior strabismus surgery; or (3) history of head traumathat could lead to skew deviation, trochlear nerve palsy, or both. Twelve healthy subjects served as control subjects (mean [SD] age, 31 [7] years; median age, 29 years; age range, 20-45years; 8 women). The research protocol was approved by theResearch Ethics Boards of The Hospital for Sick Children andUniversity Health Network. Informed consent was obtained fromall of the subjects. MEASUREMENT OF OCULAR TORSION Ocular torsion was quantitatively measured using double Mad- dox rods. While wearing a trial frame, a red Maddox rod lenswas placed in front of each eye. The direction of the glass rodswas aligned with the 90° marks of the trial frame. The subjectwas instructed to fixate on a small white penlight located 1 maway in the midsagittal plane at eye level. This distance waschosen so that a standardized target could be used in both theupright and supine positions."
ecs80017_899_905,"Through the Maddox rods, theimages of the penlight appeared as 2 red horizontal streaks. Ifone or both horizontal streaks were perceived as slanted, thesubject was instructed to rotate the lens(es) until the streak(s)became perfectly horizontal. Three trials were performed whilethe subject sat in an upright position (ie, subjects were not al-lowed to adopt their usual abnormal head posture, if present),and the trials were repeated while the subject lay in a supineposition with the head maintained in the neutral position. Themean value of the final position of the lenses from the 3 trialswas used for analysis. The mean within-subject variability was0.20° in patients with skew deviation and 0.21° in patients withtrochlear nerve palsy. MEASUREMENT OF VERTICAL MISALIGNMENT The magnitude of vertical strabismus was measured by the prism and alternate cover test. While sitting upright with the headerect (ie, subjects were not allowed to adopt their usual abnor-mal head posture, if present), the subject fixated on a singleletter eof optotype size 3/32 inch (12-point font size) located 1 m away in the midsagittal plane at eye level. Prisms of in-creasing power were placed over the deviated eye while the coveralternated between the eyes. The highest prism strength whenno refixation movement occurred was recorded. The test wasrepeated with the subject lying in a supine position. DATA ANALYSIS To compare torsion between the upright and supine posi-tions, a torsion change index (TCI) score, defined as (T up−T supine)/ (Tup/H11001Tsupine), was calculated, where T upis torsion in the up- right position and T supineis torsion in the supine position. A TCIscore of 1.0 indicates complete disappearance of torsion when changing from the upright position to the supine position,whereas a TCI score of 0.0 indicates no change between posi-tions. Similarly, a vertical change index (VCI) score, definedas (V up−V supine)/(V up/H11001Vsupine), was calculated, where V upis ver- tical misalignment in the upright position and V supineis verti- cal misalignment in the supine position."

The between-subjects factor wasthe diagnosis (skew deviation, trochlear nerve palsy, and healthy)and the within-subjects factors were the hypertropic and hy-potropic eyes. The VCI scores were analyzed using analysis ofvariance. If significant ( P/H11021.05), the specific effects of each fac- tor were analyzed further with post hoc Tukey tests. RESULTS For patients with skew deviation (n=10), the mean (SD) age was 25 (18) years (age range, 9-63 years) ( Table 1 ). Seven were women. The mean (SD) duration of symp-toms was 48 (42) months (range, 15-145 months). Fourpatients had lesions affecting both the cerebellum andmedulla, 3 had primarily cerebellar lesions, and 2 hadprimarily brainstem lesions ( Table 2 ). In a 10th pa- tient with a history of acute lymphoblastic lymphoma,leptomeningeal enhancement was evident on magneticresonance imaging. All of the 10 patients had abnormalocular torsion in 1 or both eyes (see later). Of the 10 pa-tients, 6 (60%) had abnormal head tilt toward the sideof the hypotropic eye; the other 4 had no head tilt. Thus,the complete ocular tilt reaction was present in 60% ofpatients. Five patients had bilateral lesions in the poste-rior fossa, 3 had unilateral lesions in the medulla and/orcerebellum with contralesional hypertropia, and 2 hadunilateral pontomesencephalic lesions with ipsilesionalhypertropia. The vertical strabismus was comitant in 8patients, incomitant in 1, and alternating in 1.

Of the 14 patients, 9 (64%) exhibited anabnormal head tilt toward the hypotropic eye; the other 5had no head tilt. No patients had any neurologic findings.

ecs80017_899_905,"For ex-ample, in patient S9, the 10° of excyclodeviation of thehypotropic right eye in the upright position decreasedto 2° of excyclodeviation in the supine position using thedouble Maddox rods test (no torsion was found in thehypertropic left eye). Consistent with this subjective find-ing, fundus photography (RetCam; Massie Laborato-ries, Inc, Pleasanton, California) of the hypotropic righteye revealed a reduction from 12° (upright) to 2° (su-pine) of excyclodeviation ( Figure 2 ). Excyclodeviation was found in the hypertropic eye in 10 of 14 patients with unilateral peripheral trochlear nervepalsy in the upright position (71%; patients T1-T9 andT11) (Figure 1B). It was abnormal (ie, /H110222.4°) in 8 of these 10 patients (patients T2-T9). In contrast to patients withskew deviation, the abnormal torsion in patients withtrochlear nerve palsy did not change significantly be-tween positions. For example, in patient T4, the hyper-tropic right eye exhibited 10° of excyclodeviation in theupright position, which increased slightly to 11° of ex-cyclodeviation in the supine position (no torsion wasfound in the hypotropic left eye). Figure 1C shows that in healthy subjects, up to 6° of cyclodeviation was present; however, this cyclodeviationdid not exhibit any significant difference between head po-sitions.

COMMENT The principal finding in this investigation is that the ab- normal torsion and vertical misalignment in patients withskew deviation are head position dependent—they de-crease substantially or disappear completely when thehead changes from an upright erect position to a supineposition. This head position–dependent reduction in tor-sion and vertical misalignment was present whether thepatients had isolated cerebellar lesions, isolated brain-stem lesions, or combined lesions. In contrast, in uni-lateral peripheral trochlear nerve palsy, there are littleor no changes in torsion or vertical deviation in differ-ent head positions. In healthy humans, static lateral head tilt activates the utricles, which results in sustained conjugate low-amplitude counterroll of the eyes and a small vertical de-viation. 14-16Head rotation toward the right shoulder is accompanied by counterrolling of both eyes combinedwith slight upward movement of the right eye and down-ward movement of the left eye."
ecs80017_899_905,"16This reflexive vertical divergence is minimally compensatory to downward dis-placement of the right eye and upward displacement ofthe left eye relative to the earth-horizontal plane due tothe head tilt. 16 The ocular tilt reaction is a pathological synkinetic triad of skew deviation, ocular torsion, and head tilt. It has beenattributed to lesions in the vestibular organ and its nerveas well as central connections within the brainstem orcerebellum that asymmetrically disrupt the utriculo-ocular pathway. 1-3,10Brandt and Dieterich9reviewed 56 patients with skew deviation. They found abnormal ocu-lar torsion in all of the patients, with both eyes affectedin 50%, only the hypotropic eye affected in 31%, and onlythe hypertropic eye affected in 19%. 9When abnormal tor- sion was present, the hypotropic eye was invariably ex-cyclodeviated and the hypertropic eye incyclodeviated. 9 Only 61% of patients had abnormal head tilt toward thehypotropic eye, ie, the complete ocular tilt reaction. Ros-tral pontomesencephalic lesions were associated with ip-silesional hypertropia and caudal pontomedullary le-sions with contralesional hypertropia. 9The clinical characteristics of our patients with skew deviation arein close agreement with those described by Brandt andDieterich. 9 The hair cells on the maculae of the utricles have a wide range of polarization vectors that are sensitive tohead motion in different directions, and they are ori-ented roughly in the horizontal plane. Thus, the utriclesare responsible for detecting horizontal head displace-ment (ie, right-left and fore-and-aft head movements) aswell as static head tilt (ie, head position with respect to gravity). Normally, balanced signals from the utriculo-ocular pathway are used to align the head’s vertical axisand the eye’s vertical meridian with the absolute earth-vertical plane (gravity) when stationary. Damages to theutriculo-ocular pathway lead to an erroneous internal es-timate of the absolute earth-vertical plane (gravity), ie,the brain erroneously computes that the head is tilted de-spite the facts that the head is in an upright erect posi-tion and that the utricles lie in the horizontal plane."
ecs80017_899_905,"Thetriad of head tilt, skew deviation, and abnormal torsionseen in ocular tilt reaction represents a righting re-sponse, the goal of which is to realign the vertical axesof both the head and the eyes to the internal estimate,albeit erroneous, of the absolute earth-vertical plane. 4 It is difficult to precisely predict the effects of head ori- entation on torsional and vertical eye positions in a dis-eased state and whether these effects are dependent on thelocation of lesions for several reasons. First, the mor-phological arrangement of maculae in the utricles is com-plex—the axes of polarity of the hair cells are multidi-rectional and they reverse direction across a curvilinearmidline landmark in the maculae, called the striola. 17,18 Thus, signals of opposing directions of stimulation canbe elicited from either side of the striola (lateral or me-dial) in each utricle and from either labyrinth (right orleft). Second, the exact anatomy of the utriculo-ocularpathway, by which signals from the utricles reach the ocu-lar motoneurons, is not well understood. Although theutriculo-ocular pathway has traditionally been thoughtto be disynaptic, 19there is growing evidence that more complex polysynaptic pathways involving an extensivenetwork within the cerebellum may play a more impor-tant role. 20We postulate that when changing from an upright position to a supine position, the orientation ofthe utricles changes from the earth-horizontal plane tothe earth-vertical plane. This new orientation of the utriclewith respect to the absolute earth-vertical plane (grav-ity) leads to a saturation or reduction in the overall ac-tivities of the utriculo-ocular reflex, such that any asym-metry of the reflex (as in skew deviation) is minimized.This overall saturation or reduction in activities andasymmetry of the reflex in turn lead to a reduction in tor-sion and vertical misalignment in skew deviation."
ecs80017_899_905,"Al-though the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated,our findings that torsion and vertical misalignment de-crease when changing from an upright position to a su-pine position in patients with skew deviation are con-sistent with the currently accepted role of the utricles indetecting changes in head orientation and provide sup-port that skew deviation is caused by disruption of theutriculo-ocular reflex. In isolated unilateral peripheral trochlear nerve palsy, the utriculo-ocular pathway remains intact. Thus, the mag-nitude of vertical deviation and excyclodeviation in thehypertropic eye remains the same in different head po-sitions. The contralateral head tilt commonly seen in uni-lateral trochlear nerve palsy is a compensatory mecha-nism that exploits the normal intact utriculo-ocular reflexto minimize the magnitude of vertical deviation and dip-lopia. Sydnor et al 21found that the head tilt in unilateral trochlear nerve palsy disappears in the supine position.

Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ on 06/15/2023 Because there is no change in utricular input with roll tilts when supine, the utriculo-ocular reflex is no longereffective in reducing the vertical deviation in unilateraltrochlear nerve palsy in the supine position; thus, the headtilt disappears. 21 Trochlear nerve palsy is typically diagnosed with the clinical 3-step test.13In contrast, the vertical misalign- ment in skew deviation does not follow any set patterns;it may be comitant or incomitant, or it may even be al-ternating with right hypertropia on right gaze and lefthypertropia on left gaze. 7,22,23Some skew deviations are known to mimic trochlear nerve palsy during the 3-steptest. 24,25Conversely, trochlear nerve palsy with spread of comitance may simulate a comitant skew deviationbecause in both conditions the head is usually tilted to-ward the side of the hypotropic eye."
ecs80017_899_905,"Because bothskew deviation and trochlear nerve palsy may resultfrom brain trauma or from lesions in the posteriorfossa, 26differentiating these 2 conditions can be chal- lenging. In this situation, indirect ophthalmoscopy isuseful—the fundus is excyclodeviated in the hyper-tropic eye in patients with trochlear nerve palsy, but itis incyclodeviated in the hypertropic eye in patientswith skew deviation (if torsion is present). In addition,the fundus of the hypotropic eye in patients with skewdeviation may be excyclodeviated. 9,27,28 The double Maddox rods test as well as the prism and alternate cover test are simple and quick. They also havethe advantage of not requiring pupillary dilation or in-direct ophthalmoscopy, which may not be readily avail-able or feasible for nonophthalmologists, including neu-rologists and orthoptists. Although the magnitude (butnot direction) of torsion estimated by double Maddox rods(subjective torsion) may differ from the measurement byfundus photography (objective torsion), 29our results pro- vide the basis of additional tests that could be used clini-cally to differentiate skew deviation from trochlear nervepalsy: ocular torsion and vertical misalignment that de-12Upright Supine 610 8 024 S1 S2 S4 S5 S7 S8 S10 S3 S6 S9Vertical Deviation, PD Vertical Deviation, PD Vertical Deviation, PD25 1520 10 5 0 T1 T2 T4 T5 T7 T8 T10 T11 T12 T13 T14 T3 T6 T9 10 68 4 2 0 H1 H2 H4 H5 H7 H8 H10 H11 H12 H3 H6 H9A B C Figure 4.

LAVIN, MD, BRIAN MOHNEY, MD, AND LATIF HAMED, MD ●PURPOSE : To describe ocular motility and neuro- ophthalmologic ﬁndings in six patients with an ocular tiltreaction (OTR) that mimicked an inferior oblique palsy(IOP). ●DESIGN : Observational Case Series. ●METHODS : Series of six patients presenting to tertiary care pediatric or neuro-ophthalmologist. ●RESULTS : Five patients had ocular motility and three- step test results suggesting an IOP; one patient had asuspected bilateral IOP. All six patients had excyclotor-sion of the hypotropic eye, and four had incyclotorsion ofthe hypertropic eye. This is contrary to that expectedwith an IOP (incyclotorsion of the hypotropic eye). Inaddition, all six patients had other neurologic ﬁndings in See also pp. 757–759. the history or examination that were associated withneurologic insult rather than an isolated IOP. Twopatients had surgery consisting of a superior rectusrecession; this was successful in eliminating diplopia inboth patients and in eliminating the vertical deviation andhead posturing in one patient. ●CONCLUSION : While many vertical deviations that appear to be due to an inferior oblique palsy based on theresults of the three-step test may be caused by inferioroblique weakness, skew deviation should also be consid-ered in any patient with a history of head trauma, orother neurologic ﬁndings. The cyclotorsion observed inIOP is opposite that seen with OTR, and differentiatesthe two entities clinically. We postulate that these devi-ations are caused by damage to the otolithic projections that correspond to those from the ipsilateral posteriorsemicircular canal (on the side of the hypotropic eye).(Am J Ophthalmol 2001;132:751–756. © 2001 byElsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.) SKEW DEVIATION IS A VERTICAL MISALIGNMENT OF the eyes. It was originally thought to be a comitantdeviation without ocular torsion."
donahue2001,"However, this was due to the results from an earlier study that excluded allpatients with torsion so as not to confuse them withcyclovertical muscle palsy. Current teaching now regardstorsion as a common, if not constant, ﬁnding in skew. 1 Skew deviation is currently thought to occur as a result oflesions to the supranuclear or prenuclear pathways thatsubserve the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex, and which connectthe vestibular apparatus to the vertical gaze center and thevertical extraocular muscle subnuclei. The ocular tiltreaction is a particular type of skew deviation that consistsof a triad of vertical ocular misalignment, bilateral oculartorsion, and a head tilt; the head and the superior pole ofboth eyes are rotated towards the hypotropic eye. We recently described ﬁve patients with tonic ocular tilt reactions where the ocular deviation mimicked a superioroblique palsy using the three-step test. 2However, in each of those patients, the hypertropic eye was incyclotorted.This was inconsistent with a true superior oblique palsy,where the hypertropic eye is excyclotorted. We postulatedthat lesions to the otolithic vestibular-ocular reﬂex path-ways corresponding to those of the contralateral anteriorsemicircular canal (that is, on the side of the hypotropiceye) were responsible, and cautioned that skew deviationmay mimic superior oblique palsy. Unlike superior oblique palsy, the concept of an isolated inferior oblique palsy is inherently disturbing. There is nodirect evidence (other than analysis of versions and thethree-step test) to support the existence of isolated inferioroblique palsy, and secondary muscular atrophy or de-creased force generation in this setting has never beendescribed.

In this paper, we report six patients who had vertical ocular deviations with three-step test results suggesting aninferior oblique palsy; one of these patients appeared tohave a bilateral inferior oblique palsy. However, all ofthese patients had ocular torsion opposite that seen withan inferior oblique palsy; whereas the hypotropic eye in aninferior oblique palsy should be incyclotorted, this eye wasexcyclotorted in all six patients. We believe these patientshad an ocular tilt reaction rather than an inferior obliquepalsy, and we postulate that the responsible lesion affectedotolithic projections corresponding to those of the poste-rior semicircular canal ipsilateral to the “paretic ”inferior oblique (that is, on the side of the hypotropic eye).

donahue2001,"study was reviewed and approved by the Vanderbilt Insti-tutional Review Board, and informed consent was ob-tained from all patients. Patients with ocular motilitydisturbances were identi ﬁed and examined. Orthoptic measurements (alternating prism and cover test) wereperformed in cardinal gaze positions. Ocular torsion wasdetermined by double Maddox rod, indirect ophthalmos-copy, and fundus photographs. 4Six patients were identi- ﬁed to have orthoptic measurements consistent with inferior oblique palsy based on the results of the three-steptest (one bilateral) (Table 1). The cases are detailed below. CASE REPORTS ●CASE 1 : A 55-year-old man developed vertical double vision soon after a midbrain stroke. His history was signi ﬁcant for hypertension and aortic regurgitation, and he was being treated with benzepril. Examination demonstrated a small right head tilt and chin up head position (Figure 1). Visual acuity was 20/20in each eye. There was no evidence of thyroid disease ormyasthenia. Ocular motility demonstrated a /H110022 underel- evation of the right eye in adduction and 2 /H11001overdepres- sion of the right eye in adduction. He ha d a 6 prism diopter left hypertropia that increased to 12 prism diopters in leftgaze and was 12 prism diopters in left head tilt (that is,three-stepping to a right inferior oblique palsy). Thepatient was orthotropic in right head tilt, right gaze, anddown gaze, but had 8 prism diopters of left hypertropia onup gaze. Double Maddox rod testing demonstrated 5degrees of right excyclotorsion, and this was con ﬁrmed by fundoscopy, which showed right excyclotorsion and leftincyclotorsion. T-2 weighted MRI images of the braindemonstrated a hyperintense lesion in the left midbrain, consistent with an ischemic stroke (Figure 2). One year after the onset of symptoms, the patient ’s diplopia had not resolved. He underwen ta3m m recession of the left superior rectus."

The verti-cal diplopia did not change over the preceding fourmonths. Examination demonstrated visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes. She had a small right head tilt. Ocular motilitydemonstrated limitation of elevation in adduction of theright eye, with mild overdepression of the right eye inadduction. There were 10 prism diopters of left hypertropiain primary position that increased to 15 prism diopters onleft gaze and to 10 prism diopters on left head tilt(three-step test results consistent with right inferioroblique palsy). The patient was orthotropic in right gazeand had 2 prism diopters of left hypertropia with right headtilt. Double Maddox rod testing demonstrated 5 degrees ofincyclotorsion of the left eye and 7 degrees of excyclotor-sion of the right eye. This was con ﬁrmed with fundus photography. Follow-up examination three months later found no change in ocular motility or symptoms. She declined eyemuscle surgery. ●CASE 3 : A 38-year-old woman complained of double vision following a posterior fossa decompression for aChiari malformation. Examination demonstrated visualacuity of 20/60 RE and 20/50 LE, limited by oscillopsia asa result of nystagmus. External examination showed a lefthead tilt.

DISCUSSION THE REPORT BY SCOTT AND NANKIN5OF EIGHT PATIENTS having ocular motility ﬁndings suggestive of an inferior oblique palsy was expanded to include 28 post-surgicalpatients in 1996. 6Other large series of patients with similar vertical deviations were reported by Olivier andVon Noorden 7(n/H110056) and by Pollard8(n/H1100525), bringing the total from these three large series to 59 cases. Manysingle case reports have also been published. In all fourlarge series, 5–8the criteria for the diagnosis of inferior oblique palsy was based on an analysis of the versions andthe ful ﬁllment of the three-step criteria to identify a paretic muscle. However, in most of these cases, detailedpatient histories were not provided, and detailed neuro-logic examinations were reported only for some. MRimaging was performed on only 8 of the 59 patients.

However, all had clinical ﬁndings, or imaging studies suggesting posterior fossa pathology. Thepatient who reported diplopia following cataract extrac-tion (case 5) could have had local myotoxicity from theretrobulbar injection or thyroid eye disease as a cause ofher diplopia, but she also had downbeat nystagmus andsaccadic pursuit indicating posterior fossa disease (cerebel-lar). In addition, all ﬁve patients with unilateral “inferior oblique palsy ”had excyclotorsion of the hypotropic eye when measured with either the double Maddox rod or byobserving the ocular fundus. Patients with inferior obliquepalsies should have incyclotorsion of the hypotropic eye asthe inferior oblique muscle is an excyclotorter; however,our patients had the opposite. Kushner has elegantly pointed out the de ﬁciencies of the three-step test in diagnosing a single isolated muscle palsyas a cause of vertical strabismus. 3He correctly pointed out that skew deviation can mimic oblique muscle palsy, butthat the deviation is typically more comitant and that the“amount and direction of cyclotropia may be inconsistent. ” The three-step tests works best for diagnosing an isolatedacute fourth nerve palsy and has minimal usefulness inother circumstances. Nevertheless, it is still used to con-ﬁrm suspected isolated inferior oblique palsy even when no other signs of third nerve dysfunction exists. 5–8We believe"
donahue2001,"it is distinctly unusual for an individual muscle to beparetic in the absence of any other associated weakness ofthe rest of a motor nerve, and therefore have remainedhighly suspicious of “isolated inferior oblique palsy ”in most circumstances. We have used the more descriptiveterms “underelevation in adduction ”and“overdepression in adduction ”rather than “inferior oblique underaction ” and“superior oblique overaction ”to recognize this. We believe that a hypertropia that appears to be an inferior oblique palsy can occur with damage to theotolithic projections corresponding to those from theposterior semicircular canal ipsilateral to the “paretic ” muscle (that is, on the side of the hypotropic eye). Theﬁbers subserving the vestibulo-ocular re ﬂex connect the vestibular nuclei to the extraocular muscle subnuclei in ahighly specialized fashion. 9Damage to these ﬁbers causes skew deviation and the ocular tilt reaction.10,11Brandt and Dietrich ﬁrst proposed that asymmetric unilateral posterior canal damage could produce a vertical strabismus with anipsilateral excyclotropia, 10,11 but did not describe how the vertical deviation could ful ﬁll the requirements of the three-step test for an inferior oblique palsy. The posteriorsemicircular canal has excitatory projections to the ipsilat-eral superior oblique and contralateral inferior rectus, andinhibitory projections to the ipsilateral inferior oblique andcontralateral superior rectus. Unilateral damage to theseprojections (on the right side, for example) would result inright excyclotorsion (decreased excitation of right superioroblique, and disinhibition of right inferior oblique), and aleft hypertropia (decreased excitation of left inferior rectus,and disinhibition of left superior rectus), ful ﬁlling step one of the three-step test for a right inferior oblique palsy. Thedeviation would be greatest in left gaze (in the direction ofmaximal vertical function of the vertical recti of the lefteye), ful ﬁlling step two. Finally, on left head tilt, the"
donahue2001,"normal left utricle would produce increased activity to theleft superior rectus and contralateral right inferior rectus,increasing the left hypertropia. Head tilt to the right wouldactivate the right superior rectus and left inferior rectus,decreasing the left hypertropia, and ful ﬁlling step three of the three-step test. (Coincident damage to the right utricleor its projections, if it occurred, would not change the headtilt results, as the left utricle would function unopposedand still create a worsening left hypertropia with left headtilt.) It is important to recognize that although the rightinferior oblique appears to be “paretic ”by the results of the three-step test, this muscle actually has increased tonusbecause of its disinhibition, and this is responsible for theobserved excyclotorsion. The only difference between the motility ﬁndings in a right-sided ocular tilt reaction and a right inferior obliquepalsy is the torsion of the hypotropic eye. In the ocular tiltreaction, the hypotropic eye is excyclotorted, where with aninferior oblique palsy, it is incyclotorted. In a true isolatedIOP the hypertropic eye should have no torsion since theparetic eye is the hypotropic one. In a OTR that mimics anIOP, the hypertropic eye should have either no torsion or aslight incyclotorsion (the oblique muscles are affected in thehypotropic eye and the vertical recti are affected in thehypertropic eye) and that is the case in our patients. Olivier and Von Noorden evaluated ocular torsion in ﬁve of the six patients he reported in his series. 7No patients were reported to have any torsion when testedusing the double Maddox rod, although this is a relativelyinsensitive test in cyclovertical muscle palsy. Kutzchke andScott did not report results of torsion testing in theirevaluation of 28 patients. 6Pollard noted that 20 of his 25 patients had torsion measured, and that it averaged 7degrees of incyclotorsion (range 0 to 11 °). 8However,"
donahue2001,"which eye was intorted was described only in two of thecases, and how torsion was measured was also not de-scribed. It is possible that the incyclotorsion described byPollard was in the hypertropic eye in some of his patientsand that they suffered from an ocular tilt. MR imaging wasperformed on only 8 of these 59 patients. Brandt and Dietrich have shown that unilateral brain- stem lesions caudal to the upper pons produce a skew withthe hypotropic eye ipsilateral to the lesion whereas pa-tients with lesions rostral to the upper pons have acontralateral hypotropia. 12–14The patient with a left mid- brain lesion, and a right ocular tilt reaction (case 1) isconsistent with previous studies 1,10 –13and with our hy- pothesis. The otolith-ocular pathways from the right ves-tibular system pass through the left midbrain, andasymmetric damage to the posterior canal system greater S KEWDEVIATION AND INFERIOR OBLIQUE PALSY VOL.132,NO.5 755 than that to the anterior canal system would result in the motility ﬁndings this patient exhibited. Our previous report described ﬁve patients with skew deviation who had three-step test results that ful ﬁlled the criteria for superior oblique palsy, but had incyclotorsion ofthe hypertropic eye. 2We postulated that lesions to the otolithic pathways corresponding to those of the anteriorsemicircular canal on the side of the hypotropic eye couldbe responsible. 2Our current report extends the spectrum of skew deviation as it relates to presumed oblique muscledysfunction. We believe that patients with unilaterallesions primarily affecting anterior canal projections willhave a vertical deviation that appears to be a contralateralSOP, 2whereas those with damage primarily to the poste- rior canal projections will appear to have an ipsilateralIOP. Symmetric bilateral damage to both vestibular-ocularcanal projections produces a typical comitant skew. Someof our patients likely had asymmetric lesions, since thepathways run together. Theoretically, bilateral lesions toVOR projections may produce oblique dysfunction andpattern strabismus, and we believe we have seen suchcases."
donahue2001,"This might account for the high level of neurologicdysfunction seen in patients with congenital pattern stra-bismus, and is being reported elsewhere. 14 The surgical management of the patients we described is not yet well determined. Surgical management after longterm stability should be based upon a careful analysis ofversions and the comitancy of the vertical deviation,noting any secondary restriction. Superior rectus recessioncorrects both torsion and the vertical deviation, whereassuperior oblique tenotomy on the side of the hypotropiceye will worsen the excyclotorsion. Recognizing oculartorsion in the setting of a vertical deviation is thereforeimperative in determining the proper management of thesedifﬁcult motility problems.REFERENCES 1. Brandt T, Dieterich M.

donahue2010,"A-pattern strabismus with overdepression in adduction: A special type of bilateral skew deviation? Sean P. Donahue, MD, PhD,a,b,cand Prat Itharat, MDa BACKGROUND Skew deviation is an acquired vertical ocular misalignment caused by damage to the pre- nuclear vestibular inputs to the ocular motor nuclei. A-pattern strabismus often has bilat-erally symmetric vertical incomitance and overdepression in adduction (superior oblique overaction) and can be associated with developmental delay, cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, spina biﬁda, or posterior fossa or other brainstem disease. The purpose of this study is todescribe the ocular motility and torsion ﬁndings in patients with A-pattern strabismus andbilateral overdepression in adduction (superior oblique muscle overaction) and to proposea possible brainstem mechanism underlying these observations. RESULTS Most of the 13 patients identiﬁed had other neurologic abnormalities, including spina biﬁda, hydrocephalus, perinatal stroke, or global delay. Only 2 patients had vertical ocular misalignment in primary gaze. Of the 13, 7 had incomitant vertical tropias during lateralgaze, and 12 had bilateral incyclotorsion documented on fundus examination. Despite hav-ing bilateral overdepression in adduction (superior oblique overaction), 11 of the 13 had nodifference in vertical ocular misalignment with alternating head tilt rather than reversinghypotropias as would be expected from primary oblique dysfunction. The ﬁndings are con-sistent with damage to the utricular pathways corresponding to the anterior semicircularcanal and a resulting posterior canal predominance to the extraocular muscle subnuclei that creates increased tonus to the depressors, bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS A-pattern strabismus may, in some cases, represent a special form of skew deviation. The ocular motility and clinical ﬁndings are consistent with bilateral damage to the utricularpathways corresponding to the anterior semicircular canals rather than bilateral primarysuperior oblique muscle overaction. ( J AAPOS 2010;14:42-46)"
donahue2010,"The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying thedevelopment of pattern strabismus are not wellunderstood. Many theories, including primary oblique muscle dysfunction, disruption of binocular fusion, sensory torsion, abnormal muscle innervation, topograph- ical displacement of muscles, and abnormalities within theorbit or muscle pulleys, have been proposed, 1-10and likely each of these is causative in some cases. V-pattern strabis-mus is often associated with infantile esotropia and inter-mittent exotropia, whereas A-pattern strabismus typicallyoccurs in the setting of developmental delay, hydrocepha-lus, and posterior fossa disease. 11-13 The vestibulo-ocular system maintains eye position during head movement to stabilize ﬁxation. Its function un-derlies the ocular counterrolling reﬂex. The sensory organsare the semicircular canals and the otoliths. The semicircularcanals sense angular acceleration and respond dynamicallywhereas the otoliths (saccules/utricles) sense linear accelera- tion (primarily gravity) and produce a tonic response. 14,15 The afferent pathways from the vestibular end organs project in a very well-ordered manner to the individual ex- traocular muscle subnuclei (Table 1 ).14The anterior semi- circular canal pathways are excitatory to the ipsilateralsuperior rectus muscle and contralateral inferior obliquemuscle (elevators) yet inhibit the yoke depressor mus-cles—the ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle and contralat- eral superior oblique muscle. Similarly, the posterior canal pathways excite the ipsilateral superior oblique andcontralateral inferior rectus muscles (depressors) whilethey inhibit the yoke elevator muscles—the ipsilateral infe-rior oblique and contralateral superior rectus muscles. 14 Pitching the head forward stimulates the anterior semi- circular canals bilaterally, resulting in bilateral ocular eleva-tion ( Table 2 ). Likewise, pitching the head back stimulates both posterior semicircular canals, and the resulting bilat-eral ocular depression maintains eye position on a targetthat is essentially moving downward with respect to thehead. 14Head tilts stimulate the anterior and posterior canal"

It is usually accompanied by abnormal binoc- ular torsion, torticollis, and a tilt in the subjective visualvertical. This constellation is known as the ocular tilt reac-tion. 19Previously we described groups of patients having skew deviation that mimicked either a superior obliquepalsy 20or inferior oblique palsy21when the vestibular path- ways are affected asymmetrically. A later article hypothe-sized that oblique dysfunction could be produced by abnormalities in the ‘‘pitch’’ plane. 22 The purpose of this study was to further this hypothesis: namely, to suggest that some forms of A-pattern strabismus"
donahue2010,"may be caused by bilateral lesions of the otolithic-ocularpathways that correspond to those of the anterior semicir-cular canal pathways. Because anterior and posterior canalstimulation produces pitch responses in opposing direc-tions ( Table 2 ), anterior semicircular canal pathway dam- age results in a predominance of input from the posteriorsemicircular canal, resulting in bilateral incyclotorsionand tonic downgaze that is held in check by ﬁxation.Throughout this report, we will mean that damage occursto the utricular pathways that correspond to those of a par-ticular (anterior or posterior) semicircular canal pathwaybut may simply state the individual semicircular canal path-way that is damaged, recognizing that skew deviation represents a tonic rather than a phasic response and that verbiage becomes very extensive otherwise. Methods After institutional review board approval, charts of outpatients seen at Vanderbilt University Medical Center by the primaryauthor (SPD) were searched from 1997 to 2008 with the Interna-tional Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases diagnostic code ofA-pattern exotropia. Beginning in approximately 2000, some patients were identiﬁed prospectively at the time of their clinicvisit and recorded in a database. Three patients were excluded from the study because of a lack of head tilt measurements.Patients were also excluded if they had previous strabismus surgery, thyroid disease, myasthenia, or known oblique muscle palsy. This search resulted in 13 patients with A-pattern stra-bismus who had associated overdepression in adduction. Data compiled included measurements of ocular deviation in up- gaze, primary gaze, downgaze, right gaze, and left gaze. Measure-ments were also made in right and left head tilt positions. Thedegree of ‘‘superior oblique muscle overaction’’ (overdepressionin adduction) was also recorded. Incyclotorsion was noted by the lo- cation of the fovea in relation to the optic nerve by the use of indirect ophthalmoscopy in the clinic and classiﬁed into mild, moderate, orsevere by the attending physician at the time of evaluation. Fundus photography, double Maddox rod testing, fusional test-"
donahue2010,"ing, or synoptophore testing was typically not performed becausethe subjects were children. Our primary comparison was the dif-ference in vertical tropia observed with right versus left head tilt.Although the etiology and pathophysiology of primary oblique muscle dysfunction is not well understood, we hypothesized that primary oblique muscle dysfunction would be associatedwith a difference in vertical tropia on head tilt (like a superior ob-lique palsy) whereas a symmetric variant of skew deviation wouldproduce a relatively comitant vertical tropia. Results Thirteen patients with A-pattern strabismus who met the in- clusion criteria were studied. The identiﬁed patients had an age range of 18 months to 36 years; 11 were female ( e-Sup- plement 1 , available at jaapos.org ). All 13 patients had at least moderate ( 12) superior oblique overaction because it was an inclusion criterion. Of the 13 patients, 11 had exotropia in primary gaze. The average amount of A pattern was 27Das measured from upgaze to downgaze. Seven patients hadchanges in vertical ocular alignment on side gaze. However,10 patients (77%) had no change in vertical ocular deviation on right compared with left head tilt. One patient (Patient 8) had 5 Dof difference, and 2 (Patients 1 and 10) had 3Dof dif- ference. In 12 patients who had fundus torsion described, allhad bilateral incyclotorsion.

Discussion Skew deviation is a vertical ocular misalignment that can becomitant or incomitant; it is caused by damage to the path-ways subserving the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex. 18An under- standing of these projections is crucial for understandingskew deviation and its variants.

Journal of AAPOSVolume 14 Number 1 / February 2010 Donahue and Itharat 43 oblique muscle palsy.20,21In these scenarios, the distin- guishing factor between skew deviation and oblique muscle palsy is the direction of ocular torsion.18Patients with su- perior oblique muscle palsies have excyclotorsion of thehypertropic eye, whereas patients with skew deviationhave incyclotorsion of the hypertropic eye 20; similarly, pa- tients with inferior oblique muscle palsies have incyclotor-sion of the hypotropic eye, whereas those with skew deviation should have excyclotorsion of that eye. 21 In our study, we sought to determine whether the A-pat- tern strabismus observed in some patients with bilateral in- cyclotorsion and overdepression in adduction was causedby primary superior oblique muscle overaction or someother etiology. We hypothesized that if A-pattern strabis-mus were caused by primary superior oblique muscle over-action, one would expect to see changes in vertical misalignment with alternating head tilt because the amount of innervation to the superior oblique musclechanges with head tilt, in a manner analogous to the obser-vation of reversing ipsilateral hypertropias during head tilttesting in patients with bilateral superior oblique musclepalsies. According to this hypothesis, a patient with true bi-lateral ‘‘primary superior oblique muscle overaction’’ willalready have incyclotorsion before tilting the head, so the"
donahue2010,"incyclorotatory drive produced by the superior rectus on ipsilateral tilt should be correspondingly less, less second-ary elevation will be produced, and a relative hypotropiashould result. This hypotropia should then reverse whenthe head is tilted in the other direction. However, in ourpatients, this result was not observed; in fact most patientshad no change in vertical alignment with alternating headtilt. This ﬁnding suggests that neither primary nor second- ary superior oblique muscle overaction is likely the cause of the clinical ﬁndings observed in these patients. Pattern strabismus can have many etiologies, and it is likely multifactorial. It would be naı ¨ve to suggest that anyone mechanism underlies the development of the patternsthat are observed in clinical strabismus practice. The pur-pose of this report is to propose another mechanism thatcan produce A patterns in some patients, especially those with structural neurologic damage in the posterior fossa or global developmental delay.We believe our observations suggest that in some pa- tients, bilateral lesions of the otolithic pathways corre-sponding to those of the anterior semicircular canal canproduce the clinical spectrum of ﬁndings we described:A-pattern strabismus, bilateral overdepression in adduc-tion, and bilateral incyclotorsion. Because the anteriorsemicircular canal pathways are excitatory to the elevators(the ipsilateral superior rectus muscle and the contralateral inferior oblique muscle) but inhibitory to the depressors (the ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle and contralateral su-perior oblique muscle), we believe damage to both anteriorsemicircular canal pathways will produce an A-pattern stra-bismus by decreasing excitatory innervation to all four ocu-lar elevators while disinhibiting all 4 depressors. This actionwill produce a downgaze bias with a tendency of both eyesto rotate down, 22as if the head is being pitched backwards. In the awake patient, this downgaze tendency is not ob-served clinically because the eyes are ﬁxated on a target. However, this tendency may explain some of the clinical"
donahue2010,"ﬁndings observed in similar patients, such as the ‘‘sunset-ting’’ observed in infants and children with acute hydro-cephalus, the lid retraction with attempted upgaze inpatients with dorsal midbrain syndrome, and the increasedpostural tonus, gait, and balance disorders in many children with cerebral palsy, developmental delay, and A-pattern strabismus. An increased prevalence of neurologic disor-ders has been previously described in patients with ‘‘supe-rior oblique overaction.’’ 11The presence of neurological structural abnormalities in patients with A-pattern exotro-pia 11,12caused both Hamed11,13and Biglan12to indepen- dently suggest that bilateral superior oblique overaction(alternating skew on lateral gaze) was caused by damage to neurologic pathways in the caudal brainstem. Our hypothesis seeks to build on these previous observations. The bilateral incyclotorsion observed in patients with A-pattern exotropia occurs because increased depressor to-nus and decreased elevator tonus produces maximal tonicinnervation to each superior oblique muscle and decreasedinnervation to each inferior oblique muscle. The resultantbilateral supramaximal incyclorotatory drive causes each medial rectus muscle to have a depressing action when the eye is in adduction. This action worsens the overdepressionTable 2.

donahue2010,"oblique muscle overaction, in a manner analogous to themechanism that potentiates overelevation in adduction inchildren with infantile esotropia and bilateral excyclotor-sion. 9,10,23Incyclotorsion in primary position is caused by maximal prenuclear activation of the superior oblique mus-cles bilaterally. Although one could hypothesize that simi- lar ﬁndings could be produced by bilateral inferior rectus palsies, such a lesion would be extremely difﬁcult to inducewithout damaging other oculomotor subnuclei (and lid andpupil abnormalities were not seen). Our hypothesis pro-poses that both inferior rectus muscles are maximally acti-vated and that overdepression in adduction occursbecause of increased depressor tonus from the superioroblique when the eye is in adduction. In addition to the incyclotorsion and overdepression in adduction observed with A-pattern strabismus, bilaterallesions of these vestibular ocular reﬂex pathways canalso be responsible for the observed lack of change invertical ocular misalignment on head tilt in alternatingdirections. On right head tilt, the right anterior semicir-cular canal pathways normally excite the right superiorrectus and left inferior oblique, whereas they inhibit the right inferior oblique and left superior rectus. However, with bilateral anterior canal damage, on right head tilt,no elevation of the right eye from right superior rectusactivation occurs because the right anterior semicircularcanal is damaged, and the right inferior rectus is thereforemaximally disinhibited as well. Likewise, the left eye can-not become relatively hypotropic because the left inferiorrectus and left superior oblique muscles have already been disinhibited, ‘‘ramped up,’’ and cannot receive addi- tional activation. We believe this mechanism underliesthe lack of vertical misalignment with head tilt in ourpatients. Two of our patients had small differences in vertical oc- ular alignment with alternating head tilt; we believe thiscan be explained by asymmetric damage to the vestibular-ocular pathways superimposed on a typical skew deviation. Two of our patients also had dissociated vertical deviations."
donahue2010,"The mechanism by which this occurs and its relationshipto the VOR pathways is unclear, but it may be that destroy-ing the VOR projections allows a dissociated vertical devi-ation to manifest itself, as proposed by Brodsky. 24 Alternatively, other mechanisms, including but not limitedto sensory torsion 9,10,23and pulley anomalies,7,8could act in concert to produce the diversity of motility ﬁndings we see in these challenging patients. A recent report25demonstrated that patients having skew deviation can be differentiated from those with su- perior oblique muscle palsy because the magnitude ofthe vertical misalignment in skew changes when the pa-tient moves from the upright to the supine positionwhereas it remains unchanged in patients with superioroblique muscle palsy. The observation is consistent with our hypothesis that damage to the otolith-ocular pathways is the substrate underlying the pathophysiologyof skew. 18,20-22Further detailed investigation of patients having pattern strabismus related to posterior fossadisease by the use of high-quality neuroimaging of theposterior fossa and the rectus muscle position withinthe orbit, measurement of torsion in various head andgaze positions, and measurement of strabismus anglewhile varying gaze position with respect to gravity will help to further elucidate these mechanisms.

Expanding the Use of Chalazion Clamps The Desmarre’s chalazion clamp provides hemostasis as well as stability and support of the eyelid during incision and curettage of a chalazion. By reversing the clamp and securing its ring over the eyelid, we have been able to use the clamp to stabilize the eyelid, provide goodhemostasis, and protect the globe during external eyelid procedures. For example, theclamp was used to facilitate excisional biopsy of a capillary hemangioma in an 11-month-old girl ( ﬁgure ) and to aid the removal of a thorn that was embedded in the upper eyelid of a 12-year-old boy. —Benjamin While, BSc, MB BS, MRCS (Eng), Tsiang Ung, BM, FRCOphth, and Tin K.

We therefore correlated clinical signs to differentiate vestibular neuritis (40 patients) from central ‘‘vestibular pseudoneuritis’’ (43 patients) in the acute situation with the final diagnosis assessed by neuroimaging. Skew deviation was the only specific but non-sensitive (40%) sign for pseudoneuritis. None of the other isolated signs (head thrust test, saccadic pursuit, gaze evoked nystagmus, subjective visual vertical) were reliable; however, multivariate logistic regression increased their sensitivity and specifi- city to 92%. The 1-year prevalence of vestibular vertigo in the general population is 5%,1and it accounts for approximately 1% of all emergency department visits.2A subset of these patients suffers the rapid onset of sustained vertigo, nausea and vomiting (in association with nystagmus, unsteady gait and head motion intolerance) known as the acute vestibular syndrome. This clinical syndrome lasts for days to weeks and is most often caused by vestibular neuritis (VN),3rarely by labyrinthitis which is characterised by associated auditory symptoms.4Most cases of the acute vestibular syndrome are ‘‘peripheral’’ (ie, reflect disease in theeighth nerve and/or labyrinth) and presumed viral in aetiology."
cnyrim2008,"3However, it is well recognised that a subset of such vertiginous patients have, instead, an acute ‘‘central’’ vestibular syndrome, so-called ‘‘vestibular pseudoneuritis’’ (VPN). It is caused by unilateral (fascicular) lesions of the entry zone of the eighth nerve,4vestibular nucleus lesions or vestibu- locerebellar lesions,56mostly caused by infarctions or multiple sclerosis plaques. Signs and symptoms may mimic VN, if there are no additional clinical brainstem and/or cerebellar signs. Differentiation of VN from VPN is clinically very relevant becausepatients with vascular VPN (who might otherwise recover well) may suffer a second, preventable infarction of the brainstem and/or cerebellum. 7 Therefore, in cases of central vestibular syndrome,further diagnostics (eg, MRI, Doppler sonography) and management (eg, thrombolysis) is warranted. In contrast, VN simply requires caloric testing and early onset treatment with glucocorticosteroids. 8 The aim of this study was to identify simple bedside signs that reliably differentiate VN from VPN in the emergency unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analysed clinical signs andbedside tests in 83 patients who presented at ourdepartment with rotatory vertigo, horizontal–rotational nystagmus and postural imbalance, without additional non-vestibular inner ear, brain- stem or cerebellar symptoms in the period 1995–2005. All patients underwent standardised historytaking and complete standardised neurological,neuro-ophthalmological and neuro-otological examination 9by a specialist for neurology and a neuro-orthoptist within the first 48 h after onset of symptoms. They underwent electronystagmog-raphy with caloric irrigation and cranial MRI withhigh resolution imaging of the brainstem andcerebellum, including diffusion weighted MRI, not later than 72 h after presentation at our clinics. In a subgroup of 28 consecutive patients includedafter 2002, video-oculography (VOG) was recordedin darkness and during visual fixation. The following clinical parameters, which can easily be assessed in the emergency room, were"
cnyrim2008,"evaluated: (a) gaze evoked nystagmus towards theaffected ear (‘‘gaze evoked’’ nystagmus towards the unaffected ear can simply be caused by spontaneous nystagmus); (b) smooth pursuit,especially vertically; (c) head thrust test, asdescribed by Halmagyi and Curthoys 10; (d) skew deviation; and (e) subjective visual vertical (SVV).9 Another parameter tested for its diagnostic valuewas suppression of spontaneous nystagmus byvisual fixation. This was assessed by measuringhorizontal peak slow phase velocity, both indarkness and during fixation of a stationary LEDby VOG, as described previously. 11 Inclusion criteria Assessment of the diagnosis of VN was based onfour criteria: (1) history of acute or subacuteonset of prolonged rotatory vertigo and posturalimbalance; (2) horizontal spontaneous nystag-mus with a rotational component; (3) hypo-/ non-responsiveness to caloric irrigation of the horizontal canal of the affected ear; and (4) nobrainstem or cerebellar lesions on high resolutioncranial MRI. Assessment of the diagnosis of VPNwas based on the above criteria (1) and (2) in addition to (3) hyporesponsiveness to caloric irrigation (not mandatory) and (4) pathologicalfindings in cranial MRI such as acute lesions of thebrainstem (including the fascicular portion of theeighth nerve and/or the vestibular nuclei) and/orcerebellum (nodulus, medial branch of posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory). Exclusion cri- teria were a history of vestibular dysfunctionbefore the acute onset of symptoms, additionalcochlear symptoms (tinnitus or acute hearing loss),other signs or symptoms of brainstem or cerebellar disorders.Short report 458 J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2008; 79:458–460. doi:10.1136/jnnp.2007.123596group.bmj.com  on November 28, 2017 - Published by http://jnnp.bmj.com/ Downloaded from  Statistical analysis Correlation between single clinical parameters and the definite diagnosis was calculated by a x2test for categorical parameters and a logistic regression for continuous measures."
cnyrim2008,"To differ- entiate between VN and VPN utilising several clinical para- meters, a multivariate approach in terms of a logistic regression was applied (fig 1). Mean peak slow phase velocities of thehorizontal component of the spontaneous nystagmus, mea- sured by VOG, were determined in complete darkness and during fixation of a stationary LED separately. A repeatedmeasures ANOVA was used to evaluate group differences. Statistics were calculated with SPSS (V.12.0.1) and MemBrain (V.02.01.04.02) software on a PC. A p value of ,0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Forty patients fulfilled the four criteria mentioned above for VN and 43 for VPN (table 1). VPN was caused by acute infarctions (n = 23), multiple sclerosis plaques (n = 12) or another aetiology(n = 8; eg, haemorrhage). Skew deviation was detected in 17 patients with VPN (median 3 u), but in none with VN (p ,0.01). Thus this sign was specific but of low sensitivity (40%). A vertical saccadic pursuit was found in 88% of cases of VPN but in only 20% of VN cases (p ,0.01). A pathological head thrust sign was foundmore often in VN (92%) than in VPN (39%; p ,0.01). Fifty-six per cent of patients with VPN had a gaze evoked nystagmus contralateral to the direction of spontaneous nystagmus, but only 17% of patients with VN (p ,0.01). The SVV deviated in all patients of both groups from true vertical towards the affected side (median in VPN 7.9 u, in VN 7.3 u; p = 0.87). Table 1 shows the frequencies of all categorical signs. Skew deviation, smooth pursuit deficit and head thrust test correlated best with the diagnoses assessed by MRI (table 1), but none of the analysed single signs was sufficiently sensitive and specific. Themultivariate logistic regression approach (fig 1) improved reliability of the clinical signs for accurate classification to 92%. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of VPN were both 92%."
cnyrim2008,"Mean peak slow phase velocity of spontaneous nystagmus, determined by VOG recordings, decreased during fixation of a target compared with complete darkness at 5.92 u/s on average in 11 patients with VN (p ,0.01). In 17 VPN patients, the horizontal slow phase velocity decreased less (at 0.78 u/s on average; p = 0.51). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a group difference (p ,0.01).

Each input neuron is activatedaccording to a ramp-shaped (top three) or sigmoid (bottom two) function with the respective input parameter as theindependent variable. The outputactivation function of the neuron is also sigmoid and depends on the activation status of the input neurons and therespective weight of each input (w1–5).

Currently, it is our clinical practice to run an MRI when patients fulfil the above mentioned criteria (1) history of acute or subacute onset of prolonged rotatory vertigo and posturalimbalance and (2) horizontal spontaneous nystagmus with a rotational component, and one or more of the following conditions: (a) skew deviation, (b) gaze evoked nystagmustowards the affected ear (opposite in direction of spontaneous nystagmus), (c) vertical saccadic pursuit, (d) normal head thrust test or (e) severe or multiple vascular risk factors. How can the results of this study improve our clinical practice ?The only specific diagnostic sign in this study was central vertical divergence of the visual axes (skew deviation).Previous studies, however, have reported on the occurrence ofskew deviation caused by rare peripheral conditions with a complete unilateral peripheral vestibular deficit (ie, of the pars superior and inferior of the vestibular nerve (eg, Ramsay–Huntsyndrome 12)).13–15The clinical relevance is further limited by its low sensitivity (40%). All other single clinical signs in this study provide insufficient specificity and sensitivity. When all fivesigns are combined (gaze evoked nystagmus, saccadic pursuit,"
cnyrim2008,"head thrust test, skew deviation, SVV), however, sensitivity and specificity increased to 92%, as demonstrated by multivariatelogistic regression (fig 1). To apply and further improve thissimple diagnostic tool, a central database is required, which must be fed with clinical parameters and the final diagnosis assessed by MRI of a large sample of patients. We therefore planto establish an internet based database on our webpage (www. schwindelambulanz-muenchen.de). The computational learn- ing process will further increase sensitivity and specificity of theclassifier, and in a second stage the tool could instantaneously indicate the probable diagnosis (without obligation) for registered users entering their patient data. In addition, analysis of the subgroup in which visual fixation suppression of spontaneous nystagmus was determined byVOG revealed the high diagnostic value of this sign. For clinical application, however, automated VOG systems are necessary, and sensitivity and specificity of the differentiation based on reduction of horizontal slow phase velocity (with a cut-offvalue) must be elaborated in a larger sample of patients.

kattah2009,"Kattah, MD; Arun V. Talkad, MD; David Z. Wang, DO; Yu-Hsiang Hsieh, PhD, MS; David E. Newman-Toker, MD, PhD Background and Purpose —Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is often due to vestibular neuritis but can result from vertebrobasilar strokes. Misdiagnosis of posterior fossa infarcts in emergency care settings is frequent. Bedside oculomotor findings may reliably identify stroke in AVS, but prospective studies have been lacking. Methods—The authors conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study at an academic hospital. Consecutive patients with AVS (vertigo, nystagmus, nausea/vomiting, head-motion intolerance, unsteady gait) with /H113501 stroke risk factor underwent structured examination, including horizontal head impulse test of vestibulo-ocular reflex function,observation of nystagmus in different gaze positions, and prism cross-cover test of ocular alignment. All underwentneuroimaging and admission (generally /H1102172 hours after symptom onset). Strokes were diagnosed by MRI or CT. Peripheral lesions were diagnosed by normal MRI and clinical follow-up. Results—One hundred one high-risk patients with AVS included 25 peripheral and 76 central lesions (69 ischemic strokes, 4 hemorrhages, 3 other). The presence of normal horizontal head impulse test, direction-changing nystagmus ineccentric gaze, or skew deviation (vertical ocular misalignment) was 100% sensitive and 96% specific for stroke. Skewwas present in 17% and associated with brainstem lesions (4% peripheral, 4% pure cerebellar, 30% brainsteminvolvement; /H92732,P/H110050.003). Skew correctly predicted lateral pontine stroke in 2 of 3 cases in which an abnormal horizontal head impulse test erroneously suggested peripheral localization. Initial MRI diffusion-weighted imaging wasfalsely negative in 12% (all /H1102148 hours after symptom onset). Conclusions—Skew predicts brainstem involvement in AVS and can identify stroke when an abnormal horizontal head impulse test falsely suggests a peripheral lesion. A 3-step bedside oculomotor examination (HINTS: Head-Impulse O"

Key Words: cerebrovascular accident /H18546diagnosis /H18546neurologic examination /H18546sensitivity and specificity /H18546vertigo Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is characterized by the rapid onset (over seconds to hours) of vertigo, nausea/ vomiting, and gait unsteadiness in association with head- motion intolerance and nystagmus lasting days to weeks.Patients often have a self-limited, presumed-viral cause fortheir symptoms known as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis,classified together as acute peripheral vestibulopathy (APV).Of the 2.6 million emergency department visits for dizzinessor vertigo annually in the United States, APV is diagnosed innearly 150 000. 1However, some patients with AVS instead harbor dangerous brainstem or cerebellar strokes that mimicAPV. 2–6Small observational studies suggest perhaps /H1135025%of acute vestibular syndrome presentations to the emergencydepartment represent posterior circulation infarctions. 3,6CT scans have low sensitivity (approximately 16%) for acuteinfarction, 7particularly in the posterior fossa,8and brain MRI is not always readily available. Studies also suggest thatfalse-negative MRI can occur with acute vertebrobasilarstrokes. 6,9,10 Consequently, bedside predictors are essential to identify patients with acute central vestibulopathies. Although classical teaching suggests a focus on long-tract or frank cerebellar signs,11,12fewer than half of AVS presen- tations have limb ataxia, dysarthria, or other obvious neuro-logical features. 6Careful eye movement assessment may be Received February 28, 2009; final revision received May 2, 2009; accepted May 20, 2009.

This test was first described in 1988 by Halmagyi and Curthoys as a bedside test forperipheral vestibular disease. 13Some authors have suggested the h-HIT be used as a definitive test to distinguish APV fromstroke in patients with AVS. 4,14Recent studies provide evidence that a normal VOR by h-HIT strongly indicates acentral localization, but an abnormal VOR is a weakerpredictor of a peripheral localization. 5,6The sign’s diagnostic usefulness is diluted principally by the fact that some patientswith abnormal h-HIT (implying APV) actually harbor lateralpontine strokes. 6 Another bedside predictor of central pathology in the acute vestibular syndrome is nystagmus, which changes directionon eccentric gaze. 5AVS should generally be associated with"
kattah2009,"a characteristic, dominantly horizontal nystagmus that beatsonly in one direction and increases in intensity when thepatient looks in the direction of the nystagmus fast phase. 15,16 Vertical or torsional nystagmus in this clinical context is aclear sign of central pathology, but most strokes presenting anAVS picture have nystagmus with a predominantly horizontalvector that mimics APV. 6What sometimes distinguishes the nystagmus typical of central AVS from APV is a change indirection on eccentric gaze 6(Video 2a/b). A third bedside predictor of central pathology is skew deviation. Skew deviation is vertical ocular misalignment that results from a right–left imbalance of vestibular tone (ie,neural firing), particularly otolithic inputs, to the oculomotorsystem. 17It often occurs as part of the pathological ocular tilt reaction—the subtle clinical triad of skew deviation, head tilt,and ocular counterroll. 17Skew is generally detected by alternate cover testing (Video 3) with or without a quantifi-able prismatic correction. Although reported in patients withdiseases of the vestibular periphery, 18skew (with or without complete ocular tilt reaction) has principally been identifiedas a central sign in those with posterior fossa pathology. 17It is most commonly seen with brainstem strokes17and has been reported as a herald manifestation of basilar occlusion.19A recent retrospective case–control study comparing oculomo-tor features in those with vestibular neuritis (ie, APV) withthose with “vestibular pseudoneuritis” (mostly due to stroke)suggests skew deviation could be a specific sign of centraldisease in patients with AVS. 5 We sought to assess the diagnostic accuracy of skew deviation for identifying stroke in AVS, including any addedvalue beyond h-HIT. We hypothesized that the presence ofskew would be insensitive but specific for stroke and that itwould add probative diagnostic information to h-HIT resultsalone. We further sought to assess the overall sensitivity andspecificity of a 3-step bedside oculomotor examination(Head-Impulse ONystagmusO Test-of-Skew [HINTS]) for differentiating stroke from APV in AVS. Materials and Methods"
kattah2009,"Data derive from an ongoing study of stroke in patients with AVS over the past 9 years. The study methods have been detailedpreviously in a report of h-HIT findings in 43 subjects6whose clinical data are also presented here in a larger series (101 subjects). Briefly, we present results of a prospective, cross-sectional study ofpatients presenting with AVS focusing on those at high risk forstroke. This Institutional Review Board-approved study was con-ducted at a single urban, academic hospital serving as a regionalstroke referral center for 25 community hospitals. Patients with thecore features of AVS (rapid onset of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, andunsteady gait with or without nystagmus) were identified primarilyfrom the hospital emergency department. Additional patients wereidentified by review of stroke admissions for cerebellar infarction.Included were patients with at least one stroke risk factor (smoking,hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, eclampsia,hypercoagulable state, recent cervical trauma, or prior stroke ormyocardial infarction). Excluded were subjects with a history ofrecurrent vertigo with or without auditory symptoms. For patients consenting to screening, the study neuro- ophthalmologist (J.C.K.) conducted a neurological and vestibularexamination (including h-HIT, prism cross-cover test for ocularalignment, and observation of nystagmus in different gaze positions)according to a standard protocol. 6A search for ocular counterroll by head-upright fundus photography to determine the presence ofcomplete pathological ocular tilt reaction was performed in patientswith either head tilt or vertical misalignment (suspected skew)without internuclear ophthalmoplegia. We defined severe truncalataxia as the inability to sit upright unassisted without the use of armsto stabilize and included patients in whom lethargy may havecontributed to their inability to sit. All patients underwent neuroimaging, generally after bedside evaluation. If neuroimaging was performed before the study evalu-ation, the examiner was masked to these results at the time of clinicalassessment. All patients (including patients with suspected APV)were admitted for observation and underwent serial daily examina-tions for evolution of clinical findings."
kattah2009,"The reference standard for astroke diagnosis was confirmation of acute stroke by neuroimaging,generally MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on the day ofthe index visit. The reference standard for a diagnosis of APV wasabsence of acute stroke in the brainstem or cerebellum by MRI withDWI, lack of neurological signs on serial examination, and acharacteristic clinical course. Most also underwent confirmatorycaloric testing of vestibular function. For predictive accuracy of skew deviation, we compared propor- tions with skew deviation in peripheral versus central cases and offerresults stratified by h-HIT findings. Based on prior literature sug-gesting that 3 subtle oculomotor signs (normal h-HIT, direction- changing nystagmus, and skew deviation) might be, in aggregate, thebest predictor of stroke in AVS, 8we analyzed these 3 signs together. A priori, we defined the HINTS examination as either benign(abnormal h-HIT plus direction-fixed horizontal nystagmus plusabsent skew) or dangerous (normal/untestable h-HIT or direction-changing horizontal nystagmus present/untestable or skew deviationpresent/untestable) and compared this test battery’s sensitivity,specificity, and likelihood ratios for the presence of stroke relative toother neurological findings and early MRI with DWI. We calculateboth positive likelihood ratios (the extent to which dangerous HINTSincrease the odds of stroke or “rule in” the disease) and negativelikelihood ratios (the extent to which benign HINTS decrease theodds of stroke or “rule out” the disease). Fisher exact and Pearson /H92732 were used for comparison of proportions with SAS 9.1 (SASInstitute Inc, Cary, NC). Likelihood ratios and CIs were calculatedwith MedCalc 9.6 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). All P values were 2-sided with P/H110210.05 considered significant. Results We screened 121 patients with AVS and excluded 19 for a history of recurrent vertigo or dizziness (7 Menie `re syn-drome, 5 vestibular migraine, 4 idiopathic recurrent vertigo,and 3 other disorders). One eligible subject refused enroll-ment."
kattah2009,"Of 101 patients reported here, 92 were identified byprimary clinical screening and 9 through review of admittedKattah et al Diagnostic Eye Signs in Acute Vestibular Syndrome 3505  at NY UNIV MED CTR LIBR on October 19, 2014 http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from  cerebellar infarcts. Fifty-nine presented initially to the emer- gency department, 4 were inpatients at symptom onset, onepresented as an outpatient, and 37 were transferred to theneurology ward from other institutions (mostly from affiliatehospital emergency departments admitted directly to thestroke service). The study population was 65% men with a mean age of 62 years (SD, 13 years; range, 26 to 92 years). The age range forpatients with stroke was 26 to 92 with 15 patients aged /H1102150 years, including 6 /H1102140 years. In 30%, only one stroke risk factor was present; the others had at least 2 risk factors. Mostwere examined within 24 hours of symptom onset (75%). In5 patients, the precise time of examination relative to symp-tom onset was unclear, because the precise time of symptomonset was unknown. Among the remaining 96 patients, themean time to first examination was 26 hours (range, 1 hour to9 days). Most patients (97%) underwent stroke protocol MRI at the time of admission. One patient underwent CT followed byopen MRI at another facility because of claustrophobia, and 3underwent CT but no MRI (one was claustrophobic, one diedbefore obtaining MRI, and one required ventriculoperitonealshunt placement and was too ill for MRI). All 3 who did nothave MRI had unequivocal cerebellar stroke by CT. Initialimaging occurred within 6 hours of study examination inmost (70%). Among the 96 patients in whom time ofsymptom onset was known, imaging occurred within 72hours of symptom onset in 97%; 2 patients were imaged at 4days and one at 9 days after AVS onset. Eight with initialnegative MRI underwent repeat MRI for unexplained signs(on initial or follow-up examination) suggesting brainstemlocalization. No patients had complications from diagnostictesting other than one claustrophobic reaction."
kattah2009,"Of 101 high-risk patients with AVS, 25 had APV and 76 had a central lesion. Peripheral lesions were confirmed bycaloric testing in 22 patients (19 with canal paresis, usuallysevere; 3 with only directional preponderance); 2 patientscould not complete testing due to discomfort and one refused.Central lesions included 69 ischemic strokes, 4 hemorrhages(one dentate nucleus, 3 pontine [2 with pontine cavernoma]),2 demyelinating disease (one presumed midbrain lesion, onemedullary lesion), and one anticonvulsant toxicity (carbam-azepine). Two patients did not have a demonstrable structurallesion on MRI that corresponded with the acute clinicalsyndrome (one patient with seesaw nystagmus and a pre-sumed midbrain lesion who had demyelinating lesions else-where in the brain and the patient with anticonvulsant toxicity). Key clinical features suggesting a central localiza-tion (n/H1100576) are presented in Table 1. These features arestratified by stroke location for ischemic lesions (n /H1100569) in Table 2. Acute auditory symptoms were infrequent but associated with strokes in the anterior inferior cerebellar artery territoryand presumed secondary to labyrinthine infarction, cochlearnucleus involvement, or both. Craniocervical pain was morecommon among patients with central than peripheral lesions(38% versus 12%, P/H110050.02). All patients were unsteady (ie, broad-based gait or difficulty with tandem walking), butsevere truncal ataxia (inability to sit without the use of armsor assistance) was seen only among those with central lesions (34% versus 0%, P/H110210.001). As expected, lateral medullary (n/H110057), lateral pontine (n/H110055), and inferior cerebellar strokes (n/H1100512) frequently mimicked APV (absent general neurolog- ical or obvious oculomotor signs), whereas medial brainstemcerebrovascular events did not (45% versus 5%, P/H110050.001)."
kattah2009,"Another 36% of these lateral brainstem and cerebellar events(including one dentate hemorrhage) had severe truncal ataxiaas their only obvious sign. Not surprisingly, medially locatedbrainstem strokes and hemorrhages were associated withoculomotor paralysis, whereas lateral brainstem and cerebel-lar cerebrovascular events were not (80% versus 0%,P/H110210.001). Skew deviation (mean, 9.9 prism diopters; range, 3 to 20 prism diopters) was present in 17% of our 101 subjects (casedescriptions in Supplement; available at http://stroke.ahajournals.org) and untestable in 4% with central lesions due to seesaw nystagmus or oculomotor paralysis. Despite the large verticalocular deviations, only 3 patients reported symptomaticdiplopia at presentation, and 2 of these had comorbid inter-nuclear ophthalmoplegia; several patients became aware oftheir diplopia during the crosscover test or developed symp-tomatic diplopia days or weeks after presentation as theiroscillopsia abated. Skew was evident in 4% (n /H110051 of 25) with APV, 4% (n/H110051 of 24) with pure cerebellar lesions, and 30%(n/H1100515 of 50) with demonstrated structural brain stem in- volvement ( /H92732,P/H110050.003). A complete ocular tilt reaction was found in 6 subjects, all with brainstem strokes (2 lateralmedullary, 2 lateral pontine, 2 interstitial nucleus of Cajal).Results of crosscover testing for skew deviation, stratified byh-HIT result, are compared with final diagnosis based onneuroimaging and clinical follow-up in Table 3. The majority(59%) of skews were associated with lateral medullary orlateral pontine strokes. Finding a skew correctly predicted thepresence of a central lesion in 2 of 3 cases of lateral pontinestroke where a positive h-HIT incorrectly suggested benignAPV and 7 of 8 cases with false-negative initial MRI."
kattah2009,"Takingskew together with h-HIT and direction-changing nystagmus asa 3-step bedside examination battery, a dangerous HINTS resultwas 100% sensitive and 96% specific for the presence of acentral lesion, giving a positive likelihood ratio of 25 (95% CI,3.66 to 170.59) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.00 (95% CI,0.00 to 0.11). Compared with traditional findings thought toindicate brainstem or cerebellar involvement in AVS, theHINTS battery was more sensitive than general neurologicalsigns (100% versus 51%), obvious oculomotor signs (100%versus 32%), or both of these taken together (100% versus 67%; allP/H110210.001; Table 1). Diagnostic accuracy of bedside findings for identifying that subset of central AVS patients with ischemicstroke can be found in Table 4. Neuroimaging by MRI with DWI was falsely negative in 8 patients with ischemic stroke (5 lateral medullary, one lateralpontomedullary, and 2 middle cerebellar peduncle infarc-tions). Negative scans were obtained 8 to 48 hours aftersymptom onset, including 4 that were negative at /H1135024 hours. Follow-up MRI an average of 3 days later (range, 2 to 10days) revealed the strokes. The sensitivity of early MRI withDWI for lateral medullary or pontine infarction was lowerthan that of the bedside examination (72% versus 100%,3506 Stroke November 2009  at NY UNIV MED CTR LIBR on October 19, 2014 http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from  P/H110050.004) with comparable specificity (100% versus 96%, P/H110051.0). MR angiography, performed in 33 of 69 with ischemic stroke, revealed unilateral vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery occlusion in 15, bilateral vertebralstenosis in 3, and was normal in 15. Four were diagnosedradiographically with vertebral artery dissection, all young(ages 26, 35, 42, and 52 years). Imaging evidence of mass effect was seen in the initial scan"
kattah2009,"in 9 patients and in follow-up scan in one patient, all withcerebellar involvement. Among these 10 of 23 patients withcerebellar infarction, 3 were lethargic, but 7 had isolated,severe truncal ataxia without other obvious neurological signsat or near the time of imaging showing mass effect. In themajority of patients with APV (92%), MRI revealed nonspe-cific areas of periventricular high signal intensity on T2 orfluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging but normal DWIcompatible with chronic gliosis, presumed secondary toischemic leukoencephalopathy in this population with /H113501 stroke risk factors.Discussion Our study demonstrates that skew deviation in AVS is strongly linked to the presence of brainstem lesions, most often ischemic strokes in the lateral medulla or pons. Thisstudy also proves that finding one of 3 dangerous, subtleoculomotor signs (normal h-HIT or horizontal nystagmus thatchanges direction in eccentric gaze or skew deviation) ismore sensitive than the combined presence of all othertraditional neurological signs for identifying stroke as a causeof AVS. The dangerous signs can be remembered using theacronym INFARCT (Impulse Normal, Fast-phase Alternat-ing, Refixation on Cover Test). Perhaps most importantly, wehave shown that a benign HINTS examination result at thebedside “rules out” stroke better than a negative MRI withDWI in the first 24 to 48 hours after symptom onset withacceptable specificity (96%). The association between skew deviation and brainstem stroke is not surprising. Although cases of primary-positionskew have been reported with peripheral vestibular disease,Table 1.

Inappropriate reliance on CT to exclude strokelikely exacerbates the problem. 21,22The consequences of such misdiagnoses can be profound with one small series ofmissed cerebellar infarctions indicating adverse outcomes in40%. 21Misdiagnosis may be more likely in younger patients who are not generally considered to be at risk for stroke.21"
kattah2009,"Vertebral artery dissections, the leading identifiable cause ofposterior circulation stroke among young adults, 23can present with an APV mimic.24We found 15 of our patients with stroke were age /H1102150 years, and 3 of these were due to dissections. Although the bedside techniques in the HINTS examina- tion are not widely known among emergency physicians,internists, or even general neurologists, those without subspe-cialty training in neuro-otology can accurately interpret subtleoculomotor findings of this type, 25suggesting that training in the use of these techniques may be possible. The 3 compo-nents of the HINTS (h-HIT of VOR function; observation fornystagmus in primary, right, and left gaze; alternate cover testfor skew deviation) can be tested in approximately 1 minuteat the bedside, whereas a more thorough, traditional neuro-logical examination generally takes 5 to 10 minutes or more.An acute MRI brain with DWI takes at least 5 to 10 minutesof scan time plus a wait time of several hours to several daysand typically costs /H11022$1000. In an era in which efficiency and cost containment are at a premium, this bedside method mayoffer a quick, inexpensive alternative to current practice.Although additional confirmatory studies in a broader rangeof acute vestibular patients are needed, our data suggest thatin time-pressured, frontline healthcare settings, this approachcould potentially supplant complete neurological examinationand neuroimaging without loss of diagnostic accuracy. We identified several possible limitations to our study findings. Threats to internal validity include a partiallyunmasked examiner and selective MRI follow-up scans. Asdescribed previously, 6the study examiner (J.C.K.), although masked to the results of imaging, was not masked to thepatient’s clinical history, general neurological examination,or obvious oculomotor findings when testing for subtler eyesigns. Observer bias in the interpretation of subtle eyefindings could have artificially inflated the sensitivity of thesesigns, but this seems unlikely for the 33% of cases in which obvious neurological findings were absent. MRI follow-upscans were obtained in only selected cases based on evolutionof new neurological signs or atypical subtle oculomotor signs."
kattah2009,"selective retesting could have led to some misclassifi-cation of strokes as APV, increasing the apparent sensitivityof the HINTS battery. However, all of these patients withAPV were followed and evolved no neurological deficitsacutely nor had strokes in clinical follow-up. Threats to external validity include generalizability of examination technique and sampling from a high-risk sub-population. Because patients were evaluated by a singleexaminer, it is unknown whether clinical findings could havebeen replicated by other examiners. The growing literature on these subtle eye signs from multiple investigators suggestsreproducibility, at least among subspecialists in the field. 4–6 We restricted our enrollment to high-risk patients with AVSwith no history of prior recurrent vertigo and at least onestroke risk factor. We chose this approach because funds werenot available to image all low-risk patients in whom MRIcould not be justified clinically. This selection led to a highlyenriched cerebrovascular cohort (76% central, 73% cerebro-vascular, 69% ischemic stroke) and patients with APV whomight be atypical (92% with leukoaraiosis). It is possible thata broader spectrum of patients with APV could have dis- closed more with negative h-HIT results (including thosewith isolated inferior vestibular neuritis 26) or the other 2 subtle signs, reducing the specificity of the “dangerous”HINTS result. However, a previous study of unselectedpatients with AVS suggests otherwise, estimating a 92%specificity when subtle eye signs were considered in astatistical prediction model. 5 Summary As has been shown previously, we found that lateral medul-lary, lateral pontine, and inferior cerebellar infarctions mimicAPV very closely, and great caution must be exercised toavoid missing these posterior circulation strokes in patientswith AVS. One in 5 strokes causing AVS affects a patientaged/H1102150 years and one in 10 a patient aged /H1102140 years. Typical neurological signs are absent in roughly half, andmore than half of those with mass effect from large cerebellarinfarctions have only severe truncal ataxia without otherobvious neurological or oculomotor signs. Initial MRIs arefalsely negative in 12% and can prove misleading out to 48hours after symptom onset."
kattah2009,"Skew deviation is an insensitive marker of central pathol- ogy but fairly specific predictor of brainstem involvementamong patients with AVS. The presence of skew may helpidentify stroke when a positive h-HIT falsely suggests aperipheral lesion. Screening patients with AVS for one of 3dangerous oculomotor signs (normal h-HIT, direction-changing nystagmus, skew deviation) appears to be moresensitive than MRI with DWI in detecting acute stroke in thefirst 24 to 48 hours after symptom onset. These “HINTS” to“INFARCT” could help reduce frontline misdiagnosis ofpatients with stroke in AVS and should be studied head-to-head for their comparative cost-effectiveness against neuro-imaging by MRI DWI.

Edlow, MDb INTRODUCTION Dizziness accounts for 3.3% to 4.4% of ED visits.1–3This translates into more than 4.3 million ED patients with dizziness or vertigo annually in the United States4and prob- ably 50 to 100 million worldwide. Dizziness means different things to different people. Patients may describe feeling dizzy, lightheaded, faint,giddy, spacey, off-balance,rocking,swaying,orspinning.Expert international consensus definitions for vestibular5and related symptoms6are shown in Box 1 . Although historically much has been made of the distinction between the terms dizziness and vertigo , current evidence (described by Kerber and Newman-Toker (Pitfalls article) elsewhere in this issue) suggests the distinction is of limited clinical usefulness.This article does not make a distinction between these terms unless specifically noted. aJohns Hopkins Hospital, CRB-II, Room 2M-03 North, 1550 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA;bDepartment of Emergency Medicine Administrative Offices, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, West CC-2, 1 Deaconess Place, Boston, MA 02215, USA* Corresponding author.E-mail address: toker@jhu.eduKEYWORDS /C15Dizziness /C15Vertigo /C15Stroke /C15Vestibular diseases /C15Diagnosis /C15Medical history taking /C15Physical examination /C15Emergency departments KEY POINTS /C15The prevailing diagnostic paradigm for diagnosing emergency department (ED) patients with dizziness is based on dizziness symptom quality or type. /C15Recent research suggests that the logic underlying this traditional approach is flawed. /C15A newer approach based on timing and triggers of the dizziness likely offers a better diag- nostic approach, especially in an unselected ED dizziness population. /C15This new approach uses timing-trigger categories to define targeted bedside history and physical exam techniques to differentiate benign from dangerous causes. /C15Evidence-based eye movement exams accurately discriminate BPPV (Dix-Hallpike test)"

The differential diagnosis of dizziness is broad, with no single cause accounting for more than 5% to 10% of cases.1This article focuses on the most common and most serious causes of new-onset dizziness in adults. More than 15% of patients presentingwith dizziness to an ED have dangerous causes. 1Sometimes, a serious cause is obvious based on the presentation (eg, dizziness with fever, cough, and hypoxia due to pneumonia). Other times, dangerous conditions can present with isolateddizziness that mimics benign problems. 7–11Misdiagnosis in this latter group is not uncommon, even when patients are evaluated by neurologists.12–16 An important clinical goal is to distinguish serious from benign causes using the fewest resources possible. On average, however, diagnosing dizziness consumesdisproportionate resources through extensive testing and hospital admission. 1,4Indis- criminate application of CT, CT angiography (CTA), and MRI has low yield and low value in this patient population,17–21yet brain imaging for dizziness continues to increase steadily over time.4Use of brain imaging varies 1.5-fold across hospitals without differ- ences in the detection of neurologic causes.22Annual spending on patients with dizzi- ness in US EDs is now $4 billion,4with another $5 billion spent on those admitted.23 Previously, the evidence base for diagnosing patients with dizziness was limited.24 A proliferation of recent research, however, has supplied clinicians with high-qualitydata to guide bedside diagnosis and management, particularly with regard to identi-fying cerebrovascular causes. This article proposes a new diagnostic paradigm basedon symptom timing and triggers, derived from recent advances in evidence-based,"
newman-toker2015,"targeted bedside examinations for specific dizziness subpopulations. New, acute dizziness presentations are focused on, and discussions about treatment are limitedexcept where specifically relevant to initial ED management. NEW DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH Accumulating evidence over the past decade suggests using a different approachbased on the timing and triggers for dizziness symptoms rather than type. 25,26Timing refers to the onset, duration, and evolution of the dizziness. Triggers refer to actions, movements, or situations that provoke the onset of dizziness in patients who haveintermittent symptoms. A timing and triggers history in dizziness results in 6 possible syndromes ( Table 1 ). This conceptual approach has been endorsed by an international committee ofBox 1 International consensus definitions for major vestibular symptoms5,6 Dizziness is the sensation of disturbed or impaired spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. This includes sensations sometimes referred to as giddiness,lightheadedness, or nonspecific dizziness but does not include vertigo. Presyncope (also near-syncope or faintness) is the sensation of impending loss of consciousness. This sensation may or may not be followed by syncope. When patients report“lightheadedness,” it should be classified as presyncope, dizziness, or both. Syncope (also faint) is transient loss of consciousness due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous completerecovery. Syncope usually leads to loss of postural control and falling. Vertigo is the sensation of self-motion (of head/body) when no self-motion is occurring or the sensation of distorted self-motion during an otherwise normal head movement. Unsteadiness is the feeling of beingunstable while seated,standing, orwalkingwithout a particular directional preference. This sensation has previously been called disequilibrium or imbalance.Newman-Toker & Edlow 578 specialists tasked with formulating vestibular research definitions27(described by Bisdorff, Staab, Newman-Toker (International Classification of Vestibular Disorders)elsewhere in this issue). Each syndrome suggests a specific differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination, which are described further. The TiTrATE acronym stands for timing, triggers, and target examinations. The Triage–TiTrATE–Test method(Fig."
newman-toker2015,"1 ) results in a new diagnostic algorithm ( Fig. 2 ). This article focuses on the 4 acuteTable 1 Timing-and-trigger–based vestibularasyndromes Timing Obligate TriggersbPresent No Obligate Triggersb New, episodic t-EVS (eg, BPPV) s-EVS (eg, cardiac arrhythmia) New, continuous t-AVS (eg, post gentamicin) s-AVS (eg, posterior fossa stroke)Chronic, persistent Context-specific chronic vestibular syndrome (eg, uncompensatedunilateral vestibular loss, presentonly with head movement)Spontaneous chronic vestibular syndrome (eg, chronic,persistent dizziness associatedwith cerebellar degeneration) Abbreviations: t-EVS, triggered episodic vestibular syndrome; s-EVS, spontaneous episodic vestib- ular syndrome; t-AVS, traumatic/toxic acute vestibular syndrome; s-AVS, spontaneous acute vestib-ular syndrome. aNote that the use of the word vestibular connotes vestibular symptoms (dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, or lightheadedness and so forth) rather than underlying vestibular causes (eg, BPPV or vestibular neuritis). bTrigger for nonspontaneous forms refer to obligate triggers (episodic), exposures (acute, continuous), and contexts (chronic) that sharply distinguish these forms from their spontaneouscounterparts. Spontaneous causes, as defined in this article, sometimes have underlying predispo-sitions or precipitants, but these are not only-and-always associations.

newman-toker2015,"Some patients with a chief symptom of dizziness have prominent associated features, suggesting a likely diag-nosis ( Table 2 ). The emphasis is on those with isolated dizziness or vertigo. Isolated excludes major medical or general neurologic symptoms but includes headache and the typical otologic (eg, hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness), autonomic (eg,nausea/vomiting), or balance (eg, gait unsteadiness/ataxia) accompaniments normally encountered in patients with acute vestibular symptoms. FOUR VESTIBULAR SYNDROMES The 4 key vestibular syndromes in ED patients presenting recent intermittent or con- tinuous dizziness are described: triggered episodic vestibular syndrome (t-EVS),spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome (s-EVS), traumatic/toxic acute vestibular syndrome (t-AVS), and spontaneous acute vestibular syndrome (s-AVS). The word vestibular refers to vestibular symptoms (dizziness, vertigo, unsteadiness, and lightheadedness), not underlying vestibular causes. For t-EVS and s-AVS, the focus is targeted bedside examination, emphasizing eye movements ( Tables 3 and 4). For s-EVS and t-AVS, the focus is targeted history taking (see Table 4 ). Although full details for individual diseases are presented in other articles in this issue, this article summarizes key aspects related to early differential diagnostic considerations. Episodic Vestibular Syndrome The episodic vestibular syndrome (EVS) involves intermittent dizziness lasting sec-onds, minutes, or hours. Episode duration is more important than total illness duration. Most such patients have multiple, discrete episodes spaced out over time. Relapsing and remitting symptoms lasting weeks at a time, such as sometimes seen in multiplesclerosis, should not be considered in this category. EVS is divided into triggered andspontaneous forms; each is discussed. Triggered episodic vestibular syndrome Approach Episodes of the t-EVS are precipitated by some specific obligate action or event. The most common triggers are head motion or change in body position (eg, arising from a seated or lying position, tipping the head back in the shower to washone’s hair, or rolling over in bed)."
newman-toker2015,"Uncommon triggers include loud sounds or Valsalvamaneuvers, among others. 5Attacks usually last seconds to minutes, depending on the underlying cause. Because some vestibular forms are provoked repetitively and Fig. 2. TiTrATE algorithm for differential diagnosis and workup of dizziness and vertigo. The TiTrATE algorithm divides acute dizziness and vertigo into 4 key categories: ( A) t-EVS and s-EVS forms of EVS and ( B) t-AVS and s-AVS forms of AVS. Each syndrome determines a tar- geted bedside examination, differential diagnosis, and tests, regardless of symptom type(vertigo, presyncope, unsteadiness, or nonspecific dizziness). Some steps may occur afterthe ED visit, as part of follow-up or during inpatient hospital admission.

Accessed April 15, 2015; with permission.)=Evidence-Based Diagnosis of Dizziness 581 frequently or patients’ nausea can linger between spells, some patients may overstate episode duration. This can usually be sorted out by careful history taking. It bears emphasis that clinicians must distinguish triggers (head or body motion provokes new symptoms not present at baseline) from exacerbating features (heador body motion worsens preexisting baseline dizziness). Head movement typically exacerbates any dizziness of vestibular cause (benign or dangerous, central or peri- pheral, or acute or chronic). The concept that worsening of dizziness with head motionequates with a peripheral cause is a common misconception. 28 The goal of physical examination in t-EVS is to reproduce a patient’s dizziness to"
newman-toker2015,"witness the corresponding pathophysiology (eg, falling blood pressure on arising orabnormal eye movements with Dix-Hallpike testing). A caveat for postural symptoms is that orthostatic dizziness and orthostatic hypotension are not always related. 29,30 Orthostatic hypotension may be incidental and misleading, especially in older patients taking antihypertensive medications.31Conversely, dizziness on arising without sys- temic orthostatic hypotension may indicate hemodynamic transient ischemic attack (TIA) from hypoperfusion distal to a cranial vascular stenosis32or, alternatively, intra- cranial hypotension.33Neurologic evaluation is probably indicated for patients with reproducible and sustained orthostatic dizziness but no demonstrable hypotension or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Prototype t-EVS causes are BPPV and orthostatic hypotension. Dangerous causes include neurologic mimics, known as central paroxysmal positional vertigo (CPPV) (eg, posterior fossa mass lesions34), and serious causes of orthostatic hypotension,35such as internal bleeding. All are associated with episodic positional symptoms but can bereadily distinguished from one another using targeted bedside history and examina- tion.

Accessed April 15, 2015; with permission.Evidence-Based Diagnosis of Dizziness 585 and CPPV can be distinguished based on characteristic eye examination differences on standard positional tests for nystagmus, including the Dix-Hallpike test (seeTable 3 ). 37 Diseases BPPV is the most common vestibular disorder in the general population, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% and increasing incidence with age.36In the ED, it is prob- ably the second most common cause, accounting for approximately 10% of ED dizzy presentations.16It results from mobile crystalline debris trapped in 1 or more semicir- cular canals (canaliths) within the vestibular labyrinth. Symptoms and signs vary based on the canal(s) involved and whether the crystals are free-floating or trapped.38Classic"
newman-toker2015,"symptoms are repetitive, brief, triggered episodes of rotational vertigo lasting morethan a few seconds but less than 1 minute, although nonvertiginous symptoms of dizziness or even presyncope is frequent. 39 The diagnosis is confirmed by reproducing symptoms and signs using canal- specific positional testing maneuvers and identifying a canal-specific nystagmus (see Table 3 ).38Because the offending canal(s) are generally not known in advance, multiple diagnostic maneuvers are typically performed. Proven bedside treatmentsto displace the offending crystals (canalith repositioning maneuvers) are also canalspecific. 37,40As discussed previously, BPPV mimics include orthostatic hypotension and CPPV. Patients with atypical nystagmus forms (eg, downbeat or horizontal) on Dix-Hallpike testing usually have CPPV, and some cases are due to posterior fossatumors or strokes. 37CPPV includes common, benign causes, such as intoxication with alcohol or sedative drugs, but such patients are more apt to complain of conti- nuous, persistent dizziness exacerbated (rather than triggered) by position changeand are usually readily diagnosed based on context and other signs of intoxication. Orthostatic hypotension is common, accounting for 24% of acute syncopal spells. 41 Classic symptoms are brief lightheadedness or a feeling of near-syncope on arising, but vertigo is common42and underappreciated.28Orthostatic hypotension is caused by numerous conditions that produce hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, or reduced vasomotor tone. The most common causes are medications and hypovolemia.41 The primary dangerous concern is internal bleeding. Strong bedside predictors of moderate hypovolemia from blood loss are postural dizziness so severe as to prevent standing and a postural pulse increment greater than 30 beats per minute, but the sensitivity of these findings is only 22%.43Furthermore, the benign postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome produces similar clinical findings.6Heart rate is not a consistent predictor of serious disease; absence of tachycardia or even relative bradycardia can occur in catastrophic conditions, such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy."
newman-toker2015,"Coexistentchest, back, abdominal, or pelvic pain should suggest intrathoracic or intra-abdominal emergencies. Dangerous diseases presenting severe orthostatic hypotension but sometimes lacking overt clues include myocardial infarction, occult sepsis, adrenalinsufficiency, and diabetic ketoacidosis. 35 Spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome Approach Episode duration for s-EVS varies, ranging from seconds to a few days, but a majority of spells last minutes to hours.44Patients are often asymptomatic at the time of ED presentation. Because episodes cannot usually be provoked at the bedside (as they can with the t-EVS), evaluation relies almost entirely on history taking. The frequency of spells varies from multiple times a day to monthly, depending on thecause. Although precipitants may exist (eg, red wine prior to vestibular migraine), many spells occur without apparent provocation. This differs from BPPV and other diseases with obligate, immediate triggers. Diagnosis may be clear-cut in typicalNewman-Toker & Edlow 586 cases. Unfortunately, classic features, such as frank loss of consciousness in vaso- vagal syncope,45headache in vestibular migraine,46and fear in panic attacks,47are absent in 25% to 35% of cases. Atypical case presentations probably contribute to diagnostic confusion in patients with such transient neurologic attacks.48 Prototype s-EVS causes include common benign, recurrent disorders, such as vestibular migraine, vasovagal syncope, and panic attacks. Although Menie `re disease is often mentioned as a common cause of s-EVS, its estimated population prevalence (0.1%49) is much lower than that of the 3 other episodic disorders. Principal dangerous causes are cerebrovascular (vertebrobasilar TIA and subarachnoid hemorrhage), cardiorespiratory (cardiac arrhythmia, unstable angina, and pulmonary embolus), and endocrine (hypoglycemia). Temporary or intermittent carbon monoxide exposureis a rare serious cause. 50 Diseases Patients with Me ´nie`re disease classically present with episodic vertigo accompanied by unilateral tinnitus and aural fullness, often with reversible sensori-neural hearing loss."
newman-toker2015,"51Only 1 in 4 initially presents with the complete symptom triad,52 and nonvertiginous dizziness is common.53Patients with suspected Me ´nie`re disease should generally be referred to an otolaryngologist, but care must be taken to avoidmissing TIA mimics with audiovestibular symptoms. 54 Vestibular migraine (previously called migrainous vertigo, migraine-associated vertigo, or migraine-associated dizziness) is a newly described form of migraine. Itis related to basilar-type migraine, 55but episodes lack a second defining brainstem symptom, such as diplopia, quadriparesis, or paresthesias.56The 2 migraine types may exist along a continuum.57With a population prevalence of approximately 1%,58vestibular migraine is a common cause of s-EVS. A definite diagnosis of vesti- bular migraine requires greater than or equal to 5 attacks with vestibular symptoms, a history of migraine headaches, and migraine-like symptoms with at least half the at- tacks.59Episode duration ranges from seconds to days.56Nystagmus, if present, may be peripheral, central, or mixed-type.56Headache is often absent.46When head- ache does occur, it may begin before, during, or after the dizziness and may differ from the patient’s other typical migraine headaches.56Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, and visual auras may occur. There are no pathognomonic signs or bio- markers, so diagnosis is currently based on clinical history and exclusion of alternative causes.59An episode similar to prior spells with long illness duration, migraine features, no red flags, and low vascular risk is sufficient for diagnosis without testing(see Table 4 ). Reflex syncope (also called neurocardiogenic or neurally mediated syncope) usually has prodromal symptoms, typically lasting 3 to 30 minutes. 60Dizziness, the most common prodrome, occurs in 70% to 75%61–63and may be of any type, including vertigo.61Although rarely seen in clinical practice, central forms of nystagmus may be identified during provocative testing, suggesting a TIA-like mechanism producingcentral vertigo."
newman-toker2015,"64In reflex syncope, episodes of near-syncope (no loss of conscious- ness) substantially outnumber spells with syncope,63so many patients likely present with isolated dizziness. The diagnosis is readily suspected if classic contextual precip-itants (eg, pain/fear for vasovagal syncope and micturition/defecation for situational syncope) are present, 65but these are absent in atypical forms, including those due to carotid sinus hypersensitivity.6Diagnosis is based on clinical history, excluding dangerous mimics (especially cardiac arrhythmia), and, if clinically necessary, canbe confirmed by formal head-up tilt table testing. 6 Panic attacks, with or without hyperventilation, are often accompanied by episodic dizziness. Dizziness begins rapidly, peaks within 10 minutes and, by definition, isEvidence-Based Diagnosis of Dizziness 587 accompanied by at least 3 other symptoms.66There may be a situational precipitant (eg, claustrophobia), but spells often occur spontaneously. Fear of dying or goingcrazy are classic symptoms but are absent in 30% of cases. 47Ictal panic attacks from temporal lobe epilepsy generally last only seconds, and altered mental status is frequent.67Hypoglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias, pheochromocytoma, and basilar TIA can all mimic panic attacks presenting with dizziness; each can produce a multi- symptom complex with neurologic and autonomic features. The most common dangerous diagnoses for s-EVS are TIA and cardiac arrhythmias. In 1975, a National Institutes of Health consensus report on TIA recommended that isolated dizziness or vertigo not be considered a TIA,68a pronouncement that has been widely accepted. Recent data, however, contradict this classic teaching. Multi-ple studies show that dizziness and vertigo, even when isolated, are the most commonpremonitory vertebrobasilar TIA symptoms and are more frequent in the days to weeks preceding posterior circulation stroke. 69–71 TIAs can present with isolated episodes of dizziness weeks to months prior to a completed infarction.72,73Dizziness is the most common presenting symptom of vertebral artery dissection,74which affects younger patients, mimics migraine, and"
newman-toker2015,"is easily misdiagnosed.13Dizziness and vertigo are the most common symptoms in basilar artery occlusion and are sometimes early and isolated.75,76Because approxi- mately 5% of TIA patients suffer a stroke within 48 hours77and rapid treatment re- duces stroke risk by up to 80%,78,79prompt diagnosis is critical. Patients with posterior circulation TIA have an even higher stroke risk than those with anterior circu- lation spells.80,81The presence of 3 or more vascular risk factors or an ABCD2score greater than or equal to 4 is a predictor of TIA in patients with s-EVS,82,83although high-risk vascular lesions may predict stroke risk more accurately than risk factor–based scoring. 84 Cardiac arrhythmias should be considered in any patient with s-EVS, particularly when syncope occurs or when exertion is a precipitant, even if the lead symptom istrue spinning vertigo. 10,42Although some clinical features during the attack may in- crease or decrease the odds of a dangerous cardiac cause,65additional testing (eg, cardiac loop recording) is often required to confirm the final diagnosis.6 Acute Vestibular Syndrome The acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) involves acute, persistent dizziness lasting daysto weeks, sometimes with lingering sequelae thereafter. Temporal evolution at onsetand in the first week is more important than total illness duration. Most such patients have a monophasic course with an early peak in symptom severity, rapid improvement in symptoms over the first week, and gradual recovery over weeks to months. Unusualcases resolve in less than 48 to 72 hours. AVS is divided into postexposure (traumatic/ toxic) and spontaneous forms; each is discussed. Traumatic/toxic acute vestibular syndrome Approach Sometimes AVS results directly from trauma or a toxic exposure (t-AVS). The exposure history is usually obvious. The most common causes are blunt head injury and drug intoxication, particularly with medications (eg, anticonvulsants)or illicit substances affecting the brainstem, cerebellum, or peripheral vestibular apparatus. Most patients experience a single, acute attack resolving gradually over days to weeks once the exposure has stopped. Depending on the nature of the trauma or"
newman-toker2015,"toxin, other symptoms, such as headache or altered mental status, may predominate. Rotatory vertigo, spontaneous nystagmus (looking straight ahead), and head-motionNewman-Toker & Edlow 588 intolerance may be absent or unimpressive if the pathologic effects are bilateral and relatively symmetric, as with most toxins. Diseases Blunt head trauma,85blast injuries,86whiplash,87and barotrauma88may cause direct vestibular nerve injury, labyrinthine concussion, or mechanical disruptionof inner ear membranes, resulting in an AVS presentation. Care should be taken not to miss a basal skull fracture or traumatic vertebral artery dissection. Traumatic brain injury may cause the postconcussion syndrome. Patients typically present with acombination of dizziness, headaches, fatigue, and minor cognitive impairments, with dizziness the most common symptom in the first 2 weeks after injury. 89 Anticonvulsant side effects or toxicity is a frequent cause of dizziness and vertigo in the ED and may present with an acute clinical picture.90Carbon monoxide intoxication is an uncommon but important cause to consider.91Aminoglycoside toxicity is a well- known cause of acute bilateral vestibular failure.92,93Gentamicin produces profound, permanent loss of vestibular function with relatively spared hearing, and toxicity may occur after even a single antibiotic dose.93Although this problem is often discovered during the course of an inpatient admission, patients may develop symptoms later andpresent to the ED. Patients usually present with predominantly gait unsteadiness andoscillopsia (bouncing vision) while walking. 94 Spontaneous acute vestibular syndrome Approach Classic AVS is defined as the acute onset of persistent, continuous dizziness or vertigo in association with nausea or vomiting, gait instability, nystagmus, and head-motion intolerance that lasts days to weeks.95Patients are usually symp- tomatic at the time of ED presentation and focused physical examination is usuallydiagnostic. Patients generally experience worsening of AVS symptoms with any head motion, including provocative tests (eg, Dix-Hallpike test). Contrary to conven- tional wisdom, these exacerbating features do not suggest an etiologic or anatomicdiagnosis 95and must be distinguished from head movements that trigger dizziness.96"
newman-toker2015,"This common source of confusion probably contributes to misdiagnosis of a periph-eral problem or positional vertigo when dizziness worsens with head movement ortesting. 28,97The difference is that a patient with s-AVS is dizzy at rest and feels worse with any head motion, whereas a patient with t-EVS is normal at rest and specific head motions induce transient dizziness. This means that positional tests, such as Dix- Hallpike test, should not be applied to AVS patients but reserved for use in EVS. The prototype s-AVS cause is vestibular neuritis (often incorrectly called labyrinthi- tis), an acute peripheral vestibulopathy without hearing loss. The primary dangerous mimic is ischemic stroke in the lateral brainstem, cerebellum, or inner ear.95Cerebellar hemorrhages rarely mimic a peripheral vestibular process.98Uncommon dangerous causes are thiamine deficiency11and listeria encephalitis.99 Although it is often assumed that strokes usually exhibit neurologic features,28 obvious focal signs are present in fewer than 20% of stroke patients with s-AVS.95Pa- tients are usually symptomatic at initial assessment and often have diagnostic eye signs. Strong evidence95suggests that a physical examination clinical decision rule using 3 bedside eye examination findings (HINTS—head impulse test, nystagmustype, and skew deviation; see Table 4 ) rules out stroke more accurately than early MRI. 90,100,101Importantly, the mere presence of nystagmus (found in both neuritis and stroke) is not as useful as the nystagmus attributes, which help differentiate the2 (see Table 3 ). Eye movement tests have excellent performance characteristics in the hands of neuro-otologists, and similar findings have been replicated by multiple investigativeEvidence-Based Diagnosis of Dizziness 589 teams around the world.102–107Nevertheless, care should be taken before applying these tests in routine ED practice, because interpretation differs between expertsand novices 108and limited instruction may not always be sufficient to yield optimal re- sults.16More extensive training with subspecialists directly observing trainees and providing immediate feedback may facilitate skill-building at tertiary care institutionswith access to such expertise, 109but new technologies may offer more widely avail-"
newman-toker2015,"able help in the near future. Recent studies have found accurate diagnosis using a portable video-oculography device that measures key eye movements quantita-tively. 110,111Such devices could eventually make subspecialty-level expertise in eye movement assessment widely available for diagnosis or training, although artifacts and related issues with quantitative recordings still currently require expertinterpretation. 112 Neuroimaging studies are often insufficient to accurately diagnose s-AVS cases. CT, the most commonly applied test, is useful to detect (or rule out) brain hemorrhages but is far less helpful for investigating suspected ischemic strokes. Retrospectivestudies suggest CT may have up to 42% sensitivity for ischemic stroke in dizzi- ness. 19,113In prospective studies, however, CT has even lower sensitivity (16%) for detecting early acute ischemic stroke,114especially in the posterior fossa (7%).107 CT should, therefore, not be used to exclude ischemic stroke in s-AVS.115Lack of un- derstanding of CT’s limitations for assessment of dizziness may lead to CT overuse and misdiagnosis.13,28Less well known is that even MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) misses 10% to 20% of strokes in s-AVS during the first 24 to 48 hours.95,101When smaller strokes (<1 cm in diameter) present with s-AVS, early MRI sensitivity is only approximately 50%.116Repeat delayed MRI-DWI (3–7 days after onset of symptoms) may be required to confirm a new infarct.90,117Routine MRI in all ED dizziness also has a low yield.21Imaging only older patients with vascular risk factors is a common practice, but the countervailing concern is that young age predisposes to missed stroke.13,118,119Stroke risk in patients presenting isolated s-AVS and no vascular risk factors is still approximately 10% to 20%, and 1 in 4 strokes occurs in a patient under age 50.95Overreliance on youth, low vascular risk, normal neurologic examination, and normal CT likely explains the high odds of missedstroke in isolated dizziness, particularly among younger stroke victims. 12,14,120"
newman-toker2015,"Diseases Vestibular neuritis is a benign, self-limited condition affecting the vestibular nerve. Some cases are linked to specific causes (eg, multiple sclerosis121), but most are idiopathic and possibly related to herpes simplex infections.122Although vestibular neuritis is usually a monophasic illness, 25% of cases have a single brief prodrome in the week prior to the attack123and others have recurrences months or years later.124 MRI with or without contrast is normal and unnecessary.125Diagnosis is based on nystagmus type and vestibular reflexes.126Early treatment with oral or intravenous steroids is supported by some evidence but remains controversial.127 When hearing loss accompanies vertigo in a neuritis-like s-AVS presentation, the syndrome is known as viral labyrinthitis, although cochleovestibular neuritis might be more appropriate. This benign presentation must be differentiated from bacteriallabyrinthitis, a dangerous disorder resulting from spread of middle ear or systemic infection that may lead to meningitis if left untreated. 128Even in the absence of sys- temic or local (otitis or mastoiditis) infection, however, this presentation should beviewed suspiciously, because inner ear strokes typically present this way 54,106,129 and may often be the cause of s-AVS with hearing loss in the ED.101 The prevalence of stroke in ED dizziness is 3% to 5%1,2,12,16,130,131and probably less for those with isolated dizziness.12Among ED dizzy patients, those with AVSNewman-Toker & Edlow 590 are a high-risk subgroup for stroke (approximately 25% of s-AVS cases).95Posterior circulation stroke typically presents with s-AVS, sometimes after a series of sponta-neous episodes in the preceding weeks or months (ie, TIAs, usually from posterior circulation stenosis, culminating in stroke). 95Almost all of these strokes (96%) are ischemic.95,98Most are initially associated with minor neurologic disability that re- covers well, absent recurrent stroke. Delays in prompt diagnosis and treatment, how- ever, can result in serious permanent disability or death.13,95Although most such"
newman-toker2015,"patients are not thrombolysis candidates by current guidelines, they may benefitfrom early secondary prevention treatments and interventions to prevent posterior fossa stroke complications. 95,115 BEDSIDE APPROACH SUMMARY For the usual ED patient with isolated dizziness or vertigo that is not obviously of traumatic or toxic cause, the goal for the syndrome-specific targeted examination is to firmly diagnose the specific benign conditions described previously. A majority of cases with initial diagnostic uncertainty are due to common cardiovascular (medica-tion-induced orthostatic hypotension and vasovagal syncope), psychiatric (panic dis- order), or vestibular (BPPV, vestibular migraine, and vestibular neuritis) disorders. These benign conditions can each be diagnosed confidently at the bedside using asyndrome-targeted history and examination. Patients whose presentations are atypical or whose targeted examination findings are suspicious for dangerous under- lying causes should undergo appropriate laboratory tests, imaging, or consultation. Bedside examinations for benign vestibular disorders probably deserve special attention in emergency medicine education and in developing decision support tools. 114,128,129Confusion over the conduct of these examinations may stem from the fact that a given clinical feature (eg, upbeat-torsional nystagmus) predicts a benigncondition in one syndrome (t-EVS, indicating typical posterior-canal BPPV) but a dangerous one in another (s-AVS, indicating a brainstem stroke). 28Thus, it is crucial to identify the timing-and-trigger syndrome before targeting the examination, some-thing seldom done in current practice, and, unfortunately, often omitted in prominent textbooks 132–134and journal articles.135Key criteria that define typical benign vesti- bular disorder cases and differentiate them from dangerous neurologic causes areshown in Tables 3 and 4. SUMMARY The prevailing diagnostic paradigm for diagnosing ED patients with dizziness is based on dizziness symptom quality or type. Recent research suggests that the logic under-lying this traditional approach is flawed. A newer approach based on timing and triggers of the dizziness likely offers a better diagnostic approach, especially in an un- selected ED dizziness population. Using this approach allows targeted bedside exam-inations of proven value to be used effectively. Future research should seek toprospectively study the new approach to dizziness for its overall diagnostic accuracy, resource efficiency, and impact on health outcomes."

baier2008,"Are signs of ocular tilt reaction in patients with cerebellar lesions mediated by the dentate nucleus? B. Baier, S. Bense and M. Dieterich Neurology Department, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany Correspondence to: Bernhard Baier , Department of Neurology , University of Mainz, Langenbeckstr . 1 , 55 1 3 1 Mainz, Germany E-mail: baierb@uni-mainz.de A sensitive clinical sign of a vestibular tone imbalance in the roll plane is the ocular tilt reaction (OTR), a com- bination of skew deviation, ocular torsion and head and perceptual tilts such as tilts of the subjective visual ver-tical (SVV).Of these O TR components tilts of SVVare the most frequent.While these signs are regularly seen inpatients with unilateral brainstem lesions, only a few case studies are available on their occurrence in patientswith cerebellar lesions.Thus, the question arises whether cerebellar structures may be involved in contra- and/or ipsiversive tilts of the perceived vertical and other signs of O TR.We used lesion-mapping techniques in a totalof 31 patients with acute cerebellar strokes, all showing at least a significant tilt of SVV . T wenty-three patientshad a contraversive tilt of the SVV; they were compared with eight patients with ipsiversive tilts. MRI/CT lesion mapping revealed that in patients showing contraversive signs of OTR in general and contraversive SVV tilts in particular the dentate nucleus was the commonly damaged structure. In contrast, in ipsiversive signs of O TR,the dentate nucleus was spared and lesions were located in the biventer lobule, the middle cerebellar peduncle,the tonsil and the inferior semilunar lobule.These data suggest that the dentate nucleus is a critical anatomicalstructure within the cerebellum, belonging to a network involved in vestibular processing such as the perceptionof verticality . Therefore, a lesion of the dentate nucleus can lead to tilts of the SVV in the contraversive direc-tion, i.e."

Keywords: cerebellum; stroke; ocular tilt reaction; dentate nucleus Abbreviations: MNI = Montreal Neurological Institute; OT = ocular torsion; OTR = ocular tilt reaction; SD = skew deviation; SVV = subjective visual vertical; VOR = vestibulo-ocular reflex; VN = vestibular nucleus Received November 2, 2007 . Revised March 27 , 2008. Accepted April 1 5 , 2008. Advance Access publication May 1 3, 2008 Introduction Clinical signs of a vestibular tone imbalance in the roll plane are the complete ocular tilt reaction (OTR) (Westheimer and Blair, 1975) or its components, consistingof the triad of head tilt, ocular torsion (OT) and skew deviation (SD), as well as tilts of the perceived subjective visual vertical (SVV). OTR and its components are causedby an imbalance in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) either due to a unilateral peripheral vestibular deficit such as a vestibular neuritis (Halmagyi et al ., 1979) or a unilateral lesion of the central vestibular pathways in the brainstem. Brainstem lesions caudal to the pons affecting the vestibular nerve and vestibular nucleus (VN) cause ipsiversive signs ofOTR, whereas lesions rostral to the pontine level affecting the medial longitudinal fasciculus and interstitial nucleus of Cajal cause contraversive signs of OTR (Halmagyi et al ., 1990; Dieterich and Brandt, 1993 a). Of these components,tilts of the perceived SVV are the most frequent (Brandt and Dieterich, 1994). While SD, OT and tilts of perceived SVV are regularly seen in patients with unilateral brainstem lesions, there are only a few case studies available on itsoccurrence in patients with cerebellar lesions (Mossmann"
baier2008,"and Halmagyi, 1997; Min et al ., 1999; Lee et al ., 2005). The study by Mossman and Halmagyi (1997) suggests that lossof inhibition due to the lesioned nodulus leads to an increase in tonic resting activity of secondary otolith neurons in the ipsilesional VN, and thus, to a contraversiveOTR. This is in agreement with older stimulation studies in animals and humans, which gave evidence that SD and contraversive head tilt occur with cerebellar ‘lesions’,whereas ipsiversive head tilt occurs with cerebellar ‘stimula- tion’ (Dow, 1938; Nashold et al ., 1969). Another model postulates that the vestibulo-cerebellum modulates activityin otolith-ocular connections so that in response to staticdoi: 1 0. 1 093/brain/awn086 Brain (2008), 131,1 44 5^ 1 4 5 4 /C223The Author (2008).

Thus, a loss of such modulation mechanisms in the vestibulo-cerebellum due to a cerebellarlesion leads to SD (Zee, 1996). However, due to the lack of systematic clinical studies there is still little in-depth knowledge about the cerebellar structures involved incontra- and ipsiversive signs of OTR in humans. Thus, the question arises as to whether abnormalities of the VOR in the roll plane in general and the tilt of perceived SVV as the most frequent sign in particular can be found in purely cerebellar lesions and, if so, which cerebellar structures maybe involved. The present study used well-established lesion analysis techniques (Rorden and Karnath, 2004) to investigate the issue of defining the key area(s) typically associated withcontra- or ipsiversive signs of OTR in cerebellar lesions. In systematically examined patients with acute predominantly"
baier2008,"unilateral cerebellar infarctions over the past 5 years, weperformed a lesion subtraction analysis between a group of patients with contraversive signs of OTR and a comparison group with ipsiversive signs who were comparable with regard to demographic and clinical data, except for the direction of the critical symptoms, the signs of OTR. Methods We found 23 consecutively admitted patients with unilateral cerebellar infarction who presented with a contraversive tilt of the static SVV (21 patients with pure unilateral infarction, and two patients with predominantly unilateral lesions that slightlyextended into the opposite tonsil or the central lobule). Tenpatients had lesions on the left and 13 patients had lesions on theright. We combined all the patients and flipped the lesions to the left side. The patients with ipsiversive signs of OTR represented the ‘comparison’ group (seven patients with pure unilateralinfarction, and one patient with predominantly unilateral lesionthat extended slightly into the opposite inferior semilunar lobuleand the tonsil). Since all of the patients admitted to our hospital with acute cerebellar strokes showed tilts of SVV, we used these asthecriteria to define two groups. All neurological defects were present with the same frequency and severity, except for the direction of the critical variable to be investigated, i.e. the sign of OTR in general and the contraversive tilt of SVV in particular.Therefore, we compared the patients with contraversive tilt of SVV with a second group of eight patients with cerebellar lesions admitted in the same period with an ipsiversive tilt of static SVV. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, acuteness andsize of lesion, frequency of OT, SD, head tilt and other ocular disturbances such as abnormalities in saccadic movements and nystagmus (Table 1). In the comparison group with ipsiversivetilts of the SVV, four patients had lesions of the left and fourlesions of the right cerebellum. In a subgroup analysis of the sample of the 31 patients, we further investigated the lesions of patients with other components of OTR, such as OT and SD.However, due to the small number of patients in the subgroups we did not calculate a subtraction analysis."

Baier et al. cues to gravitational orientation. Subjects had to adjust the target disk at the centre of the dome to the vertical. Static SVV wasdetermined by means of seven adjustments from a random offsetposition with the hemispherical dome stationary under binocularviewing conditions. Under these conditions, the normal range(/C62 SD) of the SVV is /C62.5 /C14(Dichgans et al ., 1972; Held et al ., 1975). A mean of more than /C62.5/C14of the seven measurements of the static SVV determined binocularly was considered a criterion of a pathological tilt of static SVV (Dieterich and Brandt, 1993 a). Tilts of the SVV in this setup are not simply the sensoryconsequence of the OT, which has to be measured by a red glassdirectly in front of each eye (Bixenman and von Noorden, 1982;Dieterich and Brandt, 1993 b); they are mainly related to the function of spatial perception. Spatial perception is dependent onotolith and somatosensory input, and in this setup with patientswithout relevant somatosensory deficits mainly a function ofotolith input. Fundus photographs Fundus photographs for measurements of tonic OT as a signof vestibular dysfunction were made using a scanning laserophthalmoscope. OT, in degrees, was defined as the mean of four to six fundus photographs. The position of the eye in the roll plane was determined as the angle between a straight line throughpapilla and macula and the horizontal line. With this method, thenormal eye position for both eyes is an excyclotropia of 5 /C14 (Curthoys et al ., 1991, Dieterich and Brandt, 1993 a). The net tilt angle for each eye was calculated as difference between 5/C14(normal"
baier2008,"eye position) and the measured angle of the cyclorotation. Skew deviation Measurements of vertical divergence (hypertropia/hypotropia) ofthe eyes were determined with the head upright, first by red glasstesting and second using vertical orientated prisms of increasingangles of refraction while viewing a target binocularly during gazestraight ahead. Lesion analysis Lesion analysis was done by established brain imaging lesiontechniques (Rorden and Karnath, 2004). The lesions of all patientswere documented by MRI or by CT. Of the 31 patients withcerebellar infarctions, MR scans were performed in 24 patients, CTscans in 7 patients. The MRI protocol used diffusion-weighted andT2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery imaging. Scanswere obtained on a 1.5 T echo planar imaging capable system(Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Germany). The fluid-attenuatedinversion-recovery sequence was acquired with 19 axial slices(slice thickness 5 mm) with an interslice gap of 1 mm, a field ofview of 175 /C2230 mm 2; a repetition time of 9000 ms and an echo time of 108 ms. Diffusion-weighted was performed with a single-shot echo planar imaging spin echo sequence (repetition time5000 ms, echo time 137 ms, field of view 256 /C2256 mm 2; matrix 64/C264 pixels; slice thickness 5 mm, gap 1 mm). MRI lesions were defined on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequence and verified by diffusion-weighted sequence. To fit the canonicalanterior commissure–posterior commissure orientation of the MRscans, the CT imaging protocol used the line drawn between theocciput and the lower margin of the orbita to orient the scans ineach individual. CT scanning (Picker PQ 5000) was performedwith a slice thickness of 3 mm infratentorial and 5 mm supratentorial. The initial scanning was optionally repeatedduring the following days until a firm diagnosis could be madeand the infarcted area became clearly demarcated. These late scanswere used in the present study to avoid possible artefacts due to edema or intracranial pressure. Furthermore, every lesion mapping"
baier2008,"plot was carefully examined for possible brain edema, which isalso visible in the MRI/CT scan and might distort the lesionmapping. The median time between lesion and the MRI used for the present analysis was 3 days (range 1–14 days); the median timebetween lesion and the CT scans 3 days (range 1–24 days). Using MRIcro software (www.mricro.com) lesions were mapped onto slices of a T1-weighted template MRI scan from the MontrealNeurological Institute (MNI) (www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/cgi/icbm_view). This template is approximately oriented to match Talairachspace (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). Lesions were mapped ontothe slices that correspond to z-coordinates /C055,/C049,/C043,/C037, /C031,/C025,/C019 and /C013 mm in Talairach coordinates. Results Clinical data Twenty-three (74%) of the 31 patients with acute unilateral cerebellar infarction presented with a contraversive tilt of SVV (binocular median SVV deviation 8.7/C14; range 3.5–15.0/C14), whereas only eight patients (26%) showed an ipsiversive tilt of SVV (binocular median SVV deviation 4.8/C14, range 3.3–19.8/C14). Thirteen patients with contraversive tilts of SVV had an OT (median net tilt angle of the OT of the right eyes: 6/C14, range 2–23/C14, and of the left eyes: 10/C14, range 2–13/C14) and four with ipsiversive tilts (median net tilt angle of the OT of the right eyes: 6/C14, range 2–11/C14; left eyes: 7/C14, range 3–11/C14) Thus, 57% of the patients with contraversive and 50% of the patients with ipsiversive tilt of SVV showed OT. SD was found in only six patients with contraversive tilts (median deviation 3.9/C14, range 2–11/C14) and two patients with ipsiversive tilts (2 and 8/C14)."
baier2008,"All eight patients with SD also showed the other signs of OTR, i.e. a complete OTR was only seen in a total of 8 of the 31patients (26%). Of the eight patients with ipsiversive tilts of SVV, four patients (50%) showed a head tilt to the ipsiversive side (median 10 /C14, range 5–20/C14), whereas in the group with contraversive tilts of SVV a head tilt to the contraversive side was demonstrated by eight patients (35%) (median 10/C14, range 7–20/C14). The frequencies of other ocular disturbances such as nystagmus, and abnormalsaccadic eye movements are shown in Table 1. Lesion analysis In both groups lesions included the uvula, the pyramid of the vermis, the tonsil, the flocculus, the dentate nucleus, as well as the cerebellar peduncles and hemispheres (Table 2). Figure 1A and B illustrates lesion density plots for each of the two groups. To identify the structures that arespecifically damaged in patients with contraversive and ipsiversive tilts of SVV, we subtracted the superimposedOTR and dentate nucleus Brain (2008), 131, 14 45 ^145 4 14 47 lesion of the ‘comparison’ group, i.e. the group with ipsiversive tilts, from the overlap image of the group withcontraversive tilts and vice versa.

It creates an image that highlights regions that arefrequently damaged in patients with contraversive tilts of SVV as well as regions mainly damaged in patients withipsiversive tilts of SVV.

The centre of the maximum overlap to contraversive tilts of SVV was located at x=/C013,y=/C055 and z=/C037, corresponding to the coordinates of the dentate nucleus described by Dimitrova et al . (2002). We found that this area was 63% more frequently affected inpatients with contraversive tilts of SVV than in the patientgroup with ipsiversive tilts of SVV ( /C31 2= 9.828; P= 0.006). All but 2 of the 23 patients with contraversive tilts of SVVhad a lesion involving the dentate nucleus according to thecoordinates described by Dimitrova et al . (2002). Further- more, using a 3D MRI atlas of the dentate/interposed nucleus based on a probabilistic approach, the z-value does match the maximum region of interest overlap, whereasx- and y-values do meet the extensions in MNI space of the second highest overlap (Dimitrova et al ., 2006). In contrast, we found the dentate nucleus only partly affected in threesubjects from the comparison group. However, none of thelesions from the comparison group affected the centre of the maximum overlap (see above) in the patients with contraversive tilt of SVV (Fig. 1B). If we consider the subgroup of the 13 patients with contraversive OT, we obtained a similar lesion distribution,which showed the dentate nucleus as the structure with themaximum overlap at very similar coordinates x=/C013, y=/C054 and z=/C037. Eleven patients had these lesions of the dentate nucleus, whereas in the four patients with ipsiversive OT the cerebellar hemispheres were more affected ( /C31 2= 9.590; P= 0.006) (Fig. 2A and B)."
baier2008,"Slightly different results were obtained in the subgroup of the sixpatients with contraversive SD, who not only had a maxi-mum overlap at the dentate nucleus ( x=/C012,y=/C053, z=/C037), but also at the tonsil ( x=/C06,y=/C048,z=/C043).However, the tonsil was also affected in one of the two patients with ipsiversive SD (Fig. 3A and B). To clarify the role of the dentate nucleus with respect to head tilt, lesions of the patients with contraversive tilt ofthe SVV and contraversive head tilt were compared with those of patients with contraversive tilt of SVV without head tilt. The data demonstrated that the dentatenucleus was involved in both groups ( /C31 2= 0.003; P= 0.955) (Fig. 4A and B). Discussion Our data of patients with cerebellar infarctions presenting with a vestibular tone imbalance suggest that the dentatenucleus might be a critical anatomical structure of anetwork within the cerebellum involved in the processing of vestibular information for the roll plane. It is affected in patients with contraversive tilts of SVV, OT, SD and headtilt but is significantly less involved in patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions presenting with ipsiversive signs of OTR. In addition, these data revealed thatcontraversive SVV tilts were more frequent (74%) and were associated with lesions including the middle cerebellar peduncle, the pyramid of the vermis, the tonsil, theflocculus, the nodulus, the biventer lobule, the inferiorsemilunar lobule and the uvula. Ipsiversive tilts of the SVV were less frequent (26%) and were associated with lesions of the biventer lobule, and the inferior semilunar lobuleapart from the middle cerebellar peduncle, the pyramid of the vermis, the tonsil, the flocculus and the uvula. With respect to the components of OTR, i.e. OT and SD, similarlesion distributions were obtained. Thus, apart from A B Fig."

In the normal upright position in the roll plane, the SVV is aligned with the gravitational vertical and the axes of theeyes and head are horizontal and directed straight ahead.Unilateral lesion or stimulation of the utricular or verticalsemicircular canal paths leads to an imbalance in the vestibular tone of the roll plane, resulting either in a complete OTR or in single components (Halmagyi et al ., 1979; Vibert et al ., 1996, 1999). These components were found with decreasing frequencies in brainstem lesions: themost frequent were SVV tilts (94%), followed by OT (83%)and SD (31%) (Dieterich and Brandt, 1993 a; Brandt and Dieterich, 1994).

The maximum overlap of the lesions is centred in both groups on the dentate nucleus.145 0 Brain (2008), 131, 1445^1454 B. Baier et al. With regard to the cerebellar structures associated with OTR, there are a few reports that indicate that damage of the vermis or the hemispheres is involved in the patho- genesis of SD (Wong and Sharpe, 2005). These authorsexamined five patients with cerebellar lesions of the vermisor the cerebellar hemispheres, all of whom had SD and anasymmetric static torsional VOR. Thus, the authorsconclude that cerebellar SD is due to an imbalance of theutricular-ocular reflex mediated by an asymmetry betweenthe eyes or in direction of the static torsional VOR. However, to our knowledge there are no systematic anatomical studies examining cerebellar lesions in humanswith respect to the signs of the VOR in the roll plane. Thus,the question arises as to which cerebellar structures areinvolved in the processing of vestibular signals needed forperception of verticality. One case study of two patientswith contraversive partial OTR suggested that both, lesionsof the nodulus and uvula, may lead to a contraversive OTR (Mossmann and Halmagyi, 1997). One patient had a left"
baier2008,"caudal cerebellar haemorrhage involving the left side of thenodulus and the other patient had an infarction of themedial branch of the left posterior inferior cerebellar arterythat involved the tonsil, the uvula, the biventer lobules andthe left side of the inferior vermis including the left sideof the nodulus. Here, OTR seemed to be due to aninterruption of the inhibitory projections from the lesioned nodulus to the graviceptive neurons in the ipsilateral VN. Another case study (Min et al ., 1999) that reported on two patients with contraversive incomplete OTR, one withcerebellar haemorrhage involving the nodulus and thedentate nucleus, the other with an infarct involving thenodulus, uvula and VN, supported previous results(Mossmann and Halmagyi, 1997). Other recently publisheddata on two patients with ipsiversive OTR caused by an anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction, suggested that damage to the inner ear or the root entry zone of the eighthnerve plays a role in mechanisms of ipsiversive OTR (Leeet al ., 2005). Indeed, lesions of the eighth nerve (Halmagyi and Curthoys, 1988; Schulz et al ., 1999) as well as lesions of the VN and the root entry zone were shown to causeipsiversive tilts (Dieterich and Brandt, 1993 a), whereas lesions of the vestibular pathways of the ponto-mesencephalic brainstem above the vestibular nuclei, such as the medial longitudinal fasciculus and interstitial nucleus of Cajal,cause contraversive tilts (Dieterich and Brandt, 1992, 1993 a; Brandt and Dieterich, 1994). Thus, due to the lack ofsystematic anatomical studies in the human cerebellum, thecerebellar mechanisms that lead to contra- and ipsiversivetilts, such as OTR in general and tilt of the SVV inparticular, are far from clear. Our current data shed some light on this issue by showing an association between lesions of the dentate nucleus and contraversive signsof OTR."
baier2008,"The uvula, nodulus and flocculus have extensive connec- tions to the vestibular nuclei and are parts of a networkprocessing vestibular signals, the ‘vestibulo-cerebellum’.In the present study, two patients with contraversive signs of OTR (Table 2) had involvement of large parts of the nodulus: in one of the patients the dentate nucleus was intact, whereas the other one also had a lesion affectingthe dentate nucleus. Thus, in accordance with the resultsof Mossmann and Halmagyi (1997) a lesion of the nodulussparing the dentate nucleus also led to contraversivesigns of OTR. With respect to the role of the flocculus,another important part of the ‘vestibulo-cerebellum’,the lesion in two patients with ipsiversive signs of OTR did not affect the dentate nucleus. Thus, the hypothesis of previous animal studies in rabbits (Barmack, 2003) thatlesions to the uvula, nodulus and flocculus influence theprocessing of vestibular information might also be truefor humans. But also deep cerebellar nuclei such as thefastigial and the dentate nucleus (i.e. lateral cerebellarnucleus) are connected to the vestibular nuclei in animalstudies (Brodal and Hoivik, 1964; Dickman and Fang, 1996; Bu¨ttner et al ., 1999; Delfini et al ., 2000). Electrophysiolo- gical studies in the rabbit indicate that the dentate nucleusrepresents one of the ‘relay’ sites for vestibular signals(Highstein, 1971, 1973). Corresponding results comefrom a study showing that in rabbits, neurons of thelateral cerebellar nuclei responded to head and body tiltsalong the longitudinal axes, indicating that these receptorsshould be evoked by signals from the otoliths (Favilla et al ., 1978). Other animal studies in rats investigated the effect of the dentate nucleus on balance and spatial orientationand found that rats with midline lesions comprisingthe vermis and fastigial nucleus, as well as rats withbilateral lesions involving the dentate nucleus and cerebellarhemispheres, showed a disturbance of equilibrium (Joyalet al ."
baier2008,", 1996, 2001). However, there are no studies available for unilateral lesions of the dentate nucleus in animals and only one in humans. In fact, there is one older case report on thestimulation of the dentate nucleus using stereotacticallyinserted electrodes in two patients, one having bilateraltremor, the other exhibiting athetosis of the arms (Nasholdet al ., 1969). Here, stimulation of the dentate nucleus of one side resulted in ipsiversive conjugate eye movements aswell as ipsiversive head deviation, whereas coagulation of the dentate nucleus resulted in contraversive tilting of the head and eye deviation. This report of a patient with aunilateral dentate nucleus lesion fits nicely with our currentdata. Therefore, we suggest that the dentate nucleus seemsto play a crucial role in the otolith-based perception ofverticality, and that a unilateral lesion of the dentatenucleus may cause a disturbed internal representation ofverticality of eyes, head and body. Since the deep cerebellar nuclei provide the major output station (Ruigrok et al ., 1996; Mauk, 1997) and animal studies indicate that thedentate nucleus presents an input station for vestibularsignals (Highstein, 1971, 1973), we assume that the dentatenucleus (lateral cerebellar nucleus) represents one majorstation for the processing of vestibular signals in the humanOTR and dentate nucleus Brain (2008), 131, 14 45 ^145 4 1451 cerebellum. A lesion of the input site of vestibular signals could, on the one hand, nicely explain the dysfunction ofthe perception of verticality, measured by tilts of the SVV,as well as lesion-induced vestibular ocular motor con- sequences such as OT. On the other hand, head tilt, OT and SD could also be derived from a loss of regularmotor innervation due to a lesion of the (motor) outputstation. However, a dysfunction of the motor output stationwould most probably not cause perceptual tilts but onlySD and OT, since ocular motor innervation only correctsfor the differences in pulling directions and strengths ofthe ocular muscles when the position of the eye is changed."
baier2008,"Furthermore, the role of the motor system represented by head tilt was addressed in a lesion analysis of the patientswith contralesional tilts of the SVV with and without headtilt. Since both groups showed similar anatomical results(Fig. 4A and B), it seems unlikely that the motor system hasa dominant influence. Nevertheless, considering that two of our patients with an unaffected dentate nucleus also showed a contraversive tilt of SVV and that none of our patients had an isolated lesion of the dentate nucleus, it appears that othercerebellar structures are also involved in the perception ofverticality. Therefore, we rather favour the hypothesis thatthe dentate nucleus is a crucial cerebellar structure in anetwork with visual, vestibular and somato-sensory input(Fig. 5A). In view of our present data, we suggest that the mechanisms postulated by Mossman and Halmagyi(1997), i.e. that perception of verticality is exclusively underinhibitory control of the ipsiversive nodulus, should be modified in the sense that the loss of inhibition not only from the lesioned nodulus and the uvula but also fromthe lesioned dentate nucleus as processing station leads toan increase in the tonic resting activity of secondaryneurons in the ipsilesional vestibular nuclear complexand thus to the contraversive OTR (Fig. 5B). Consideringthe patients who presented with ipsiversive tilts of SVV,a barely affected dentate nucleus and the major overlap of these lesions located in the biventer lobule and inferior semilunar lobule, we assume that disruption of inhibitorygabaergic efferents from the cerebellar cortex may leadto an enhanced activity increase of the intact dentatenucleus analogue to a stimulation of the dentate nucleus(Nashold et al ., 1969). Evidence from anterograde and retrograde tracing methods in rats suggests activitiesof dentate-vestibular connections related to postural functions (Delfini et al ., 2000). Via such projections (Highstein, 1971) the excessive inhibitory activity mayreduce tonic resting activity in the vestibular nuclearcomplex, which then leads to an ipsiversive OTR dueto the preponderance of the intact contralesional VN(Fig. 5C).

( C) Lesions of the cerebellum excluding dentate nucleus, nodulus and uvula lead to an excessive inhibitory activity of the dentate nucleus [--] due to the loss ofinhibitory efferents from the cerebellar lobule and thus to a decrease of tonic resting activity in the vestibular nuclei and consequently to an ipsiversive tilt of the SVV.1452 Brain (2008), 131, 1445^1454 B. Baier et al. Analysis of SD indicated an involvement of the tonsil. Previous case studies described SD in lesions of the nod- ulus, the vermis or the cerebellar hemispheres (Mossmann and Halmagyi, 1997; Wong and Sharpe, 2005). However,since clinical reports of unilateral SD in patients with purelycerebellar lesions are rare and the present sample of sixpatients was small, further investigations have to be done toanswer the question of whether the tonsil may be a keystation in SD or not. While otolith information is important for determining head orientation, neck and trunk proprioception might also be relevant. In fact, the results of Yardley (1990) suggestedthat proprioception might play a role in the perception ofthe SVV. Lesion comparison of the patients with contrale-sional tilt of SVV and head tilt and patients with contra-lesional tilt of the SVV without head tilt demonstrated thatthe dentate nucleus was involved in both groups (Fig. 4Aand B). Thus, the dentate nucleus is the crucial anatomical"
baier2008,"structure for the otolith-based perception of verticality, which may be associated with head tilt, but it is not thehead tilt—as a sign of motor or proprioception perfor-mance—which is related to the dentate nucleus. We cannotdefinitely exclude the possibility that other sensory input,e.g. from the somatosensory system, might mediate non-vestibular spatial orientation (Bisdorff et al ., 1996; Anasta- sopoulos et al ., 1997). Our patients, however, did not show any relevant somatosensory deficits like the patient described by Yardley (1990). Experimental observationsindicated that somatosensory information for the percep-tion of body posture and spatial orientation might haveonly modulatory character. Proprioceptive input of thelower extremities was found to only indirectly affect theperception and control of posture by implementingor modulating the output of the truncal graviceptors (Mittelstaedt, 1992, 1998). In addition, one patient with a complete left-sided sensory loss due to a thalamic lesion didnot show any difficulties in the veridical perception ofpostural upright (Karnath et al ., 2000). These data suggest that the perception of orientation in space is dependent onseveral sensory inputs, of which the otolith system seems toplay a more important role than the proprioceptive system. In conclusion, the sample of patients with unilateral cerebellar infarcts that presented with contra- and ipsiver- sive signs of OTR gave evidence that the dentate nucleus isan important anatomical structure—probably both a relayand a processing station—within a network significantlyinvolved in the perception of spatial orientation of eyes,head and body. However, the limitations of the present study should be kept in mind, since structural MRI and CT scans might not necessarily show the full functional extent of a lesion. Areas, which appear structurally intact in anatomical scans, maynot necessarily be functioning normally due to an abnormalperfusion. Therefore, perfusion-weighted imaging, whichmeasures the amount and latency of blood flow in certainregions, provides a promising new tool to address theseissues in future studies. Another limitation might be the"
baier2008,"limited spatial resolution of the MNI template used, andthe difficulty of clearly identifying the border between theinterposed and the dentate nucleus. However, evenDimitrova et al . (2006) admit that their cerebellar atlas mainly describes the localization of the dentate nucleus dueto the small size of the interposed nuclei. Indeed, our coordinates match the x,y,zextensions described by Dimitrova et al . (2002, 2006), thus supporting the conclusion that the maximum anatomical overlap inpatients with contraversive signs of OTR mainly representsthe dentate nucleus. The question of whether the dentate nucleus might also be involved in the processing of vestibular signals, asopposed to merely transmitting signals, cannot be con-clusively answered by the present study. However, since thedentate nucleus seems to be an anatomical key structure and isolated lesion or stimulation of the dentate nucleus cause signs of OTR (Nashold et al ., 1969), we assume that the function of the dentate nucleus is not only restricted totransmission but also includes processing of vestibularsignals. Furthermore, higher cognitive function of thecerebellum as demonstrated in spatial attention taskssupport the hypothesis that the cerebellum does not onlypresent a passive contributor to perceptional spatial processes (Townsend et al ., 1999; Golla et al ., 2005). Therefore, we suggest that the cerebellum in general and thedentate nucleus in particular is also involved in an activecognitive process of spatial perception.

Brandt, MD, FRCPM. Strupp, MDABSTRACT Objective: Correlation of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) with components of the ocular tilt reaction (OTR) in order to localize graviceptive (specifically otolithic) pathways in the brainstem. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of 120 patients with INO (87 unilateral [9 of whom had one-and-a-half syndrome], 33 bilateral) for OTR (subjective visual vertical [SVV], ocular tor- sion, skew deviation) to localize causative brainstem lesions in MRI. Results: Unilateral INO was accompanied by at least one component of OTR: SVV tilt in 96%, ocular torsion in 79%, and skew deviation in 50%. All components were directed to the contrale-sional side. Contralateral OTR occurred in 89% of patients with one-and-a-half syndrome. Only9% of patients with bilateral INO exhibited OTR. MRI showed distinct lesions in 68%, whichalmost exclusively projected onto the pontomesencephalic medial longitudinal fascicle (96%)."
zwergal2008,"Follow-up measurements revealed SVV and ocular torsion normalized faster than the adductiondeficit in INO. Conclusions: First, unilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is regularly associated with contra- versive ocular tilt reaction (OTR): INO plus. Thus, graviceptive pathways join the medial longitudinalfascicle after crossing between the vestibular and abducens nuclei. Second, the different time courseand degree of recovery of OTR components and INO signs can be explained by the hypothesis thatvestibular tone imbalance is compensated by central vestibular adaptation mechanisms (probablydriven mainly by cerebellar-vestibular projections), whereas impaired adduction is less susceptible tocompensation according to Hering’s law and can only be overcome by lesion repair. Third, bilateralINO is seldom associated with OTR, confirming that bilateral impairment of graviceptive pathwaysdoes not cause imbalance in roll plane. Neurology®2008;71:590–593 GLOSSARY INC/H11005interstitial nucleus of Cajal; INO/H11005internuclear ophthalmoplegia; MLF/H11005medial longitudinal fascicle; MS/H11005multiple sclerosis; OTR/H11005ocular tilt reaction; SVV/H11005subjective visual vertical. The ocular tilt reaction (OTR) is a combination of displacement of the subjective visual vertical (SVV), ocular torsion, and skew deviation. It is a sensitive sign of acute unilateralbrainstem lesions involving graviceptive (mainly otolithic) pathways from the vestibular nucleito the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC). 1-4While pontomedullary lesions cause ipsilateral OTR, pontomesencephalic lesions induce contralateral OTR, indicating the pathway crossesin-between. 2Precise localization of the level of crossing is not known. Our clinical experience has shown an association of OTR and internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is causedby ipsilateral lesions of the medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF) between the abducens andoculomotor nuclei. 5,6 Our aim was to localize graviceptive pathways within the brainstem and their level of crossing by analyzing the association of INO and OTR and their attribution to distinct brain-stem lesions.

METHODS A total of 120 consecutive patients with INO (87 unilateral [9 with one-and-a-half syndrome]; 65 women; mean age: 53.1 /H1100617.8 years; time period: 2000–2007) were retro- spectively included in the study if they met the following criteria:1) paresis of adduction or slowing of adduction saccades of oneor both eyes during conjugate horizontal gaze shift associatedwith 2) dissociated nystagmus on abduction of the other eye.The cause of INO was brainstem infarction in 92 patients (80unilateral), brainstem hemorrhage in 6 patients (2 unilateral),and multiple sclerosis (MS) in 22 patients (5 unilateral). In allpatients thin-slice MRI (3 mm) of the brainstem was performed(T1-/T2-/diffusion-/FLAIR-weighted images; proton-densityimages in single cases). Brainstem lesions were mapped after spa-tial normalization to standardized sections of a stereotaxic brain-stem atlas. 7All patients underwent complete neurologic and neuro-ophthalmologic examinations. Vertical deviation of thevisual axis (skew deviation) was measured by cover test usingprisms. Deficit of adduction was quantified by cover test usingprisms in end position of lateral gaze and clinical testing foradduction saccade slowing. Twelve patients with unilateral INOdue to lacunar infarctions and nine patients with MS were re-examined (two to four times, mean follow-up: 30 days [infarc-tions], 180 days [MS]). Psychophysical determination of the SVV was performed by"
zwergal2008,"measuring the patient’s adjustment of a bar to the vertical with-out spatial orientation clues in a dotted hemispheric dome (nor-mal range: 0 /H110062.5°; for further information, see figure e-1 on theNeurology ®Web site at www.neurology.org).2The degree of ocular torsion as determined by the angle a straight line throughthe papilla and fovea forms with the horizontal was measured onfundus photographs taken in a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. 2 Data were collected and evaluated by SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago,IL). RESULTS Correlation of INO and OTR. At least one component of OTR occurred in 98% of the 87 pa- tients with unilateral INO. All tilt effects were di-rected away from the lesion (contraversive): SVVdeviation occurred in 96% (mean: 6.1°, range: 2.6–22.1°), ocular torsion of one eye in 54%, of both eyesin 26% (mean tilt angle [exceeding the normal rangeof 0–11°]: 5.7°, range: 2.9–8.5°) (table , figure e-2).Skew deviation was found in 50% of patients, whenthe eye contralateral to the INO was undermost.Contraversive OTR was observed (SVV n /H110058, ocu- lar torsion n /H110056, skew deviation n /H110053) in a sub- group of patients (n /H110059) clinically presenting with a one-and-a-half syndrome (unilateral INO and ipsi- lateral horizontal gaze palsy). Three of 33 patientswith bilateral INO showed OTR (complete OTR inone, isolated tilt of SVV in two [table ]). Differential time course of recovery of INO and OTR. Repetitive follow-up examinations in patients withunilateral INO due to lacunar infarctions (n /H1100512)"
zwergal2008,"showed an average recovery time to the normal rangeof 15 days for SVV, 22 days for ocular torsion, and/H11022/H1102230 days for adduction deficit and abduction nys-tagmus due to INO (figure e-3). The difference be-tween the mean recovery time of OTR componentsand INO was significant. A follow-up of patientswith unilateral INO due to MS plaques revealed acomparatively prolonged recovery time with a signif-icant discrepancy of OTR and INO (average recov-ery time: SVV 100 days, ocular torsion 150 days,adduction deficit /H11022/H11022200 days). Localization of brainstem lesions in patients with OTR and INO. MRI showed lesions in 81 of 120 patients (68%; unilateral INO: 64%, bilateral INO: 79%). Lesions were almost exclusively localized in the para-median posterior tegmentum contralateral to theOTR and involved the MLF (96%). Lesions wereallocated to the level between the abducens and ocu-lomotor nuclei (most frequently in the upper pons)(figure). The majority of lesions were pinhead-sizedand did not affect other tracts outside the MLF. DISCUSSION Our major findings are as follows: 98% of cases of unilateral INO are accompanied bycontralateral OTR, in contrast to only 9% of bilat-eral INO; the correlation of unilateral INO, OTR,and lesion localization on MRI indicates that thegraviceptive (mainly otolithic) pathways cross be-tween the abducens and the vestibular nuclei; the re-covery of vestibular OTR signs significantly precedes normalization of ocular motor signs in INO. It is commonly accepted that OTR reveals imbal- ance of vestibular tone in the roll plane and is causedby unilateral lesions that convey graviceptive infor-mation for eye–head coordination. 2,4The exact to- pography of the graviceptive pathways throughoutthe brainstem, especially the level of their crossing,has not been characterized. The present study shows that unilateral INO is"
zwergal2008,"not an isolated ocular motor disorder of the horizon-tal plane but is accompanied by perceptual and ocu-lar motor dysfunction in the roll plane in 98% ofcases and therefore could be termed “INO plus syn-drome.” This is a common syndrome that could beTable Ocular motor findings in patients with unilateral INO, one-and-a-half syndrome, and bilateral INO Findings on ocular motor examinationUnilateral INO(n/H1154978)One-and-a-halfsyndrome(n/H115499)Bilateral INO(n/H1154933) SVV deviation 75 (96) 8 (89) 3 (9) Ocular torsion, monocular 42 (54) 4 (44) 1 (3) Ocular torsion, binocular 20 (26) 2 (22) 0 (0) Ocular torsion (total) 62 (79) 6 (67) 1 (3) Skew deviation 39 (50) 3 (33) 1 (3) OTR components (total) 77 (98) 8 (89) 3 (9) Percentages are in parentheses.

Neurology 71 August 19, 2008 591 detected more often by measuring for SVV tilt, ocu- lar torsion, and skew deviation. Bilateral damage of graviceptive pathways does not cause OTR because functional counterbalancingoccurs: i.e., input to the midbrain integration centersfor eye–head coordination in roll (INC) is dimin-ished, but since counterbalancing is symmetric nodeviation in roll results. The high coincidence of unilateral INO and con- traversive OTR indicates that the graviceptive path-ways run within or near the MLF in the posteriorparamedian tegmentum as confirmed by the localiza-tion on MRI. Since patients with lesions of the MLFnext to the abducens nucleus (one-and-a-half syn-drome) had signs of contralateral OTR, the crossinglevel can now be localized between the vestibular andabducens nuclei."
zwergal2008,"Thus, graviceptive pathways fromthe otoliths and the vertical semicircular canals enterthe brainstem via the medial and superior vestibularnuclei, 8cross to the opposite side at the same level or slightly above, and run with the MLF to the con-tralateral INC (figure). Rapid OTR recovery is probably the result of cen- tral vestibular compensation processes which equal-ize the tone imbalance in roll plane. This has beenreported, for example, for SVV deviation in Wallen-berg syndrome. 9The most likely mechanism seems to be a readaptation of vestibular tone driven bycerebellar-vestibular projections (from the flocculus/paraflocculus to the vestibular nuclei). 10This bottom-up mechanism is supported by the findingthat compensation of unilateral INO due to MSplaques is markedly delayed, if more lesions arefound in the vestibulo-cerebellum (unpublisheddata). Furthermore, the vestibular tone imbalancemay be partially reset at the level of the midbraincenters for eye-head coordination, e.g., by an adjust-ment of the time constants of the neural integrators.Similar top-down mechanisms have been describedfor the adaptation of the vestibular-ocular reflex fol-lowing unilateral vestibular damage. 11In contrast to compensation in the vestibular system, INO seems tobe less susceptible to recovery because of the adduc-tion deficit according to Hering’s law of equal inner-vation 12: an increase in the size of the abduction saccadic pulse may be an adaptive mechanism forimproving adduction weakness, but it worsens theabduction nystagmus. The decrease of the abductionsaccadic pulse would worsen the adduction deficit.Therefore the ocular motor deficit in INO cannot befully compensated; it requires structural and func-tional restitution of the damaged pathway.

baier2009,"OCULAR TILT REACTION: A CLINICAL SIGN OF CEREBELLAR INFARCTIONS? Ocular tilt reaction (OTR) consists of head tilt, ocu- lar torsion (OT), and skew deviation (SKD) com-bined with perceptual tilts such as deviations of thesubjective visual vertical (SVV). Few case reportshave shown that OTR also occurs in patients withcerebellar infarctions. 1-4However, no systematic clin- ical studies are available on the frequency of signs ofOTR in patients with cerebellar lesions. Therefore,the questions arose as to whether OTR is a commonclinical sign of an acute cerebellar lesion and whether the time course of its components is similar to thosefrom brainstem infarctions. The cerebellar structures in-volved in 31 patients were studied in detail elsewhere. 5 Methods. All 56 patients with acute unilateral cerebel- lar infarctions (51 ischemic; 5 hemorrhagic) admitted atour department were included in the study (median age 65 years, range 37–84 years; 37 men and 19 women).Forty-three patients had unilateral, and 13 patients withunilateral cerebellar infarctions had additional brain-stem lesions (27 patients had right-sided, 29 left-sided le- sions). All patients underwent a neuro-ophthalmologic examination including testing tilt of SVV, OT, SKD (for details, see the video 5), electronystagmography includ- ing caloric irrigation, and MRI scanning. Only two of the patients with infarctions in the territory of the ante-rior inferior cerebellar artery showed a unilateral hypo-responsiveness in the caloric testing. The medianlatency between infarction and investigation was 3 days(range 1–12 days). The vascular territory was deter-mined by using the anatomic diagrams of Tatu et al. 6 Results. Most of the 43 patients with purely unilat- eral cerebellar lesions presented with contralateral Figure Time course plotted against (A) skew deviation, (B) binocular tilts of SVV, (C) ocular torsion, and (D) monocular tilts of SVV and ocular torsion for each eye"
baier2009,"Open circles represent monocular tilts of subjective visual vertical (SVV) of each eye; filled circles represent ocular torsion of each eye. Only absolute values were taken.Bernhard Baier, MD, PhD Marianne Dieterich, MD Supplemental data at www.neurology.org 572 Neurology 72 February 10, 2009 signs: 58% showed tilts of SVV (median of the bin- ocular SVV deviation 5.1°), whereas 35% had OT(median net tilt angle of OT of the right eyes: 7°; andof the left eyes: 5°) and 14% SKD (median 3°). Ipsi-lateral signs were less frequent: 26% had tilts of SVV(median SVV deviation 5.8°), 14% OT, and 9%SKD (median net tilt angle of the right eyes: 6°; andof SKD 5°). For both ipsi- and contralateral signs ofOTR, all patients with SKD (9 patients) also showedthe other signs of OTR. Thus, a complete OTR wasseen in 21% (table e-1 on the Neurology ®Web site at www.neurology.org). The patients with combined cerebellar and brain- stem lesions showed opposite results: only 15% (2patients) had contralateral (SVV deviation 7.0° and3.0°), but 46% had ipsilateral tilts of SVV (median5.0°). Contralateral OT occurred in 15% (2 patients)(net tilt angle of the right eyes: 5°, 11°; and of the lefteyes: 7°, 13°) and ipsilateral OT in 23% of the pa-tients (median net tilt angle of the right eyes: 7.5°,and of the left eyes: 6°). Contralateral SKD was seenin one patient (5°); none had an ipsilateral SKD.Thus, there was a difference of the frequency be-tween contra- and ipsilateral tilts of SVV in patientswith pure and combined cerebellar lesions ( /H9273219.58; p/H110050). This indicates that more patients with purely"
baier2009,"cerebellar lesions had contralateral tilts of SVV. In patients with pure unilateral cerebellar lesions, the nonlinear regression models (p /H110210.01) suggest that with increasing time since lesion, OT and tilts ofthe SVV last longer than 10 days, whereas SKDwears off within around 6 days (figure). Discussion. Our data give evidence that OTR is a common sign in patients with unilateral cerebellar lesions, indicating that lesions of the cerebellum in-duce a dysfunction in otoliths pathways that mediatevestibular information in the roll plane. Single components such as tilts of the SVV can occur in up to 85% and show similar time courses tothose in brainstem infarctions 7with the skew devia- tion as the most transient sign. However, the amount of the deviations in the acute phase was less in pa-tients with cerebellar lesions (median of contralateral[5.1°] and ipsilateral SVV deviation [5.8°]), andhighest in patients with medullary brainstem infarc-tions (Wallenberg syndrome, 9.8°) compared to thatin acute vestibular neuritis (7.0°). 7Thus, signs of OTR not only indicate brainstem, thalamic, or peripheral vestibular lesions but also unilateral cerebellar lesions, which affect structuresinvolved in the processing of vestibular signals. Thesestructures seem to form a pathway from the brain-stem to the vermis (including the cerebellar pe-duncles, the dentate nucleus, pyramid of the vermis,nodulus, and uvula) and to the flocculus and tonsil. 5 The specific structures lesioned, however, deter- mine the directive of the signs, ipsilateral or con-tralateral. An affection of the dentate nucleus inparticular was associated with contralateral signs ofOTR, whereas in ipsilateral signs the dentate nucleuswas spared and lesions were located in the middlecerebellar peduncle, tonsil, biventer, and inferiorsemilunar lobules. 5 From the Department of Neurology (B.B., M.D.), University of Mainz; and Department of Neurology (M.D.), Ludwig-Maximillians-University, Munich, Germany."

All rights reserved. 1. Introduction The ocular tilt reaction (OTR) consists of head tilt, skew deviation, and ocular torsion [1]. OTR indicates a unilateral de ﬁcit of otolithic input or a unilateral lesion of the graviceptive brainstem pathway from the vestibular nucleus to the rostral midbrain, which crosses the midline at the pontine level [1].I nc a t s [2]and monkeys [3,4],e l e c t r i c a ls t i m u l a t i o n or chemical inactivation of the mesencephalon produces direction- speciﬁc tonic ocular torsion, i.e., contraversive after inactivation and ipsiversive after stimulation. In the mesencephalon, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) and the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) are involved in the generation (riMLF) and gaze holding (INC) of vertical and torsional eye movements [5,6]. Thus, lesions of riMLF lead to slowing or absence of vertical or torsional saccades whereas INC lesions cause vertical gaze limitation and gaze- holding de ﬁcits in the vertical and torsional planes [7]. Unilateral riMLFor INC lesions may be distinguished by the direction of torsional nystagmus [2–5], presence of vertical gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) [5], existence of reduced vertical ocular motor ranges [5],a n dt h ea b s e n c eo f quick phases during the torsional vestibulo-ocular re ﬂex (VOR) [3,5,6] . Previously, only a few reports described paroxysmal OTR in lesions of the midbrain or mesodiencephalic junction [8–11]. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report two"
oh2009,"patients with paroxysmal ipsiversive OTR, one with ipsiversive and the other with contraversive torsional nystagmus during the parox- ysms, due to mesodiencephalic lesions. We also reviewed the previously reported six patients. The associated ocular motor abnorm- alities allowed localization of the causative lesions to riMLF or INC in most patients. 2. Methods2.1.

Seven months later, neurological examination showed rightward head tilt (15°) and almost continuous paroxysmal ocular dyskinesia. During the quiescent periods, horizontal saccades were normal without GEN. In contrast, the range of vertical saccades was limited, and there was vertical GEN. The vertical saccadic velocity appeared to be normal within the limited range. There was no vergence or pupillary abnormality. Convergence-retraction nystagmus and eye lid abnormalities wereabsent. Other ﬁndings included left hemiparesis, spastic gait with increased deep tendon re ﬂexes on both sides. The paroxysmal OTR showed no response to carbamazepine (300 mg bid) or diphenylhydan- toin (375 mg qd), and the patient did not tolerate gabapentin 400 mg bid. 2.1.2. Patient 2 A 68-year-old woman was consulted for one-month history of abnormal eye movements. She had suffered from intracranial hemorrhage due to an aneurysmal rupture of the anterior commu- nicating artery and had undertaken a clipping operation 5 years before (Fig. 2 ). Other medical histories included toxic goiter, hypertension, diabetes and cataracts. One month before, she began to show intermittent involuntary ocular movements concurrent with right- ward head tilt. Examination showed dysarthria, quadriplegia (more severe in the left side), and increased deep tendon re ﬂexes on the left side. EEG did not show epileptiform discharges either between or during the paroxysms. Carbamazepine 400 mg/day decreased the episodes by approximately 80%. 2.2. Eye movement recordings Magnetic search coil recording of both eyes was available for patient 1, and was made with the patient sitting in a 70-cm cubicsearch coil frame [12]. Eye position calibration was conducted using a gimbal system, which could be rotated independently in yaw, pitch, and roll planes with the axes of rotation organized according to eye- ﬁxed coordinate system."
oh2009,"Eye position signals were digitized at 200 Hz using an A/D converter (EZAD, Seoul, Korea) and displayed on a computer screen to monitor eye motion during the tests. Digitized eye position data were analyzed using MATLAB software [12]. Spontaneous eye movements with/without ﬁxation and GEN in the horizontal (±30°) and vertical (±20°) planes were recorded. Horizontal saccades were generated by a target moving pseudorandomly on a light bar with a range of ±16.7°. The range of target amplitude was 5° to 30°. However, the almost continuous involuntary eye movements did not allow reliable measurements of vertical saccades or smooth pursuit, or torsional VOR. The directions of torsional nystagmus were de ﬁned by the directions of quick phase from the perspective of the patient, i.e. clockwise when the upper poles of the eyes beat to the patient's right shoulder. 3. Results3.1. Clinical ﬁndings Our patients presented with dizziness/vertigo, diplopia, oscillopsia and abnormal head movements. The paroxysms occurred 10 to 50 times a day and lasted from several seconds to minutes. Both had previous hemorrhagic lesions in the right mesodiencephalon includ- ing the thalamus and midbrain ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). In addition to our two patients, review of the literature yielded six more patients with paroxysmal OTR [8–11]. All the previously reported patients also had lesions in the mesodiencephalic junction.

Paroxysmal OTR and associated ocular motor ﬁndings Ipsiversive paroxysmal OTR developed 7 months and 5 years after the hemorrhages in our patients. In patient 1, the paroxysmal eye movements consisted of phasic depression of the right eye, elevation of the left eye, and clockwise rotation of both eyes (Video 1, Fig. 3 ), which were followed by slow return to the baseline position. Duringthe ocular torsion, conjugate torsional nystagmus was observed with the fast phase beating counter-clockwise, i.e. contraversive ( Fig. 3 ). Fundus photography during the episode also revealed a conjugate ipsiversive ocular torsion ( Fig. 4 ). The rightward head tilt appeared to aggravate during the episodes. Patient 2 showed vertical divergence of the eyes (elevated left eye and depressed right eye) with conjugate clockwise, i.e. ipsiversive, ocular torsion during the attacks (Video 2). These paroxysmal eye movements were associated with conjugate ipsiversive (clockwise) torsional nystagmus. The paroxysm occurred 10 –20 times a day and lasted from 30 s to 5 min. Fundus photography also documented clockwise (ipsiversive) torsion of the eyes during the paroxysms. Between the attacks, vertical saccades were slowed and limited in range. Pursuit eye movements were impaired in both horizontal and vertical directions. During bedside head oscillation in the coronal"
oh2009,"plane (torsional VOR) using the video-Frenzel goggles, the ipsiversive quick phases appeared to be decreased. The paroxysmal OTR was not affected by visual ﬁxation in either patient. 3.3. Imaging correlation In patient 1, brain CT obtained on the day of initial event demonstrated right thalamic hemorrhage that extended into the ventricle and mesodiencephalic junction ( Fig. 1 A). MRI 1 month later (6 months before the oculography) also revealed an area of low density in the right mesodiencephalic junction where riMLF and INC reside ( Fig. 1 B–D). In patient 2, MRI performed 5 years after the initial event disclosed encephalomalacia and hemosiderin deposit at the site of previous hemorrhage including the right thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, and lobar white matter around the deep gray. Caudal extent of the hemorrhage involved right riMLF and INC, sparing the contralateral midbrain and thalamus ( Fig. 2 ). 4. Discussion Our patients developed paroxysmal ipsiversive OTR after meso- diencephalic hemorrhage. The paroxysms of OTR in our patients and in the previously reported cases [9–11]indicate episodic hyperactivity of the neurons involved in the generation of vertical and torsional eye movements. The mesodiencephalic junction houses riMLF and INC that subserve immediate premotor control of vertical and torsional eye movements. The riMLF contains short latency burst neurons for vertical and torsional saccades, and generates pre-motor neural drive Fig. 3. Inpatient 1, three-dimensional recording of binocular motion using magnetic search coil technique (Skalar, Delft, Netherlands) discloses dissociated vertical and conjugatetorsional eye movements every 3 to 6 s. Phasic ocular deviation consists of depression ofthe right eye, elevation of the left eye, and clockwise (from the patient's perspective)rotation of both eyes, which are followed by slow return to the previous position."
oh2009,"Duringocular deviation, conjugate contraversive (beating counter-clockwise) torsional nystag-mus was observed (arrow). Since an absolute scale for torsional eye position cannot be obtained in the patients with underlying ocular torsion due to ocular tilt reaction, as in our patient, the absolute scale for torsional eye position is based on ocular torsion measured onfundus photos. Upward de ﬂection in each recording indicates rightward, upward, and clockwise eye rotations, with respect to the patient. RH = right horizontal; LH = lefthorizontal; RV = right vertical; LV = left vertical; RT = right torsional; LT = left torsional. Fig. 4. The ocular fundi during the paroxysm of patient 1 show ipsiversive (clockwise) ocular torsion. RE = right eye; LE = left eye.101 S.-Y. Oh et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 277 (2009) 98 –102 for both upward and downward saccades and for ipsiversive torsional fast eye movements [1,3] . Unilateral riMLF lesion gives rise to contraversive torsional nystagmus, limited and slowed vertical saccades and loss of ipsiversive torsional nystagmus during torsional VOR [3]. INC is a neural integrator for vertical and torsional eye movements and inactivation of INC causes ipsiversive torsional nystagmus, gaze-holding de ﬁcit for vertical and torsional saccades (GEN), and limited vertical saccades without slowing [1,5]. INC lesions also produce jerky seesaw nystagmus [13]. In contrast, excitation of INC or riMLF would cause tonic ocular torsion in the same direction, i.e. ipsiversive [3,14 –16]. However, INC and riMLF exert different effects on other ocular motor subsystems [7,17] . Accordingly, analyses of associated ocular motor ﬁndings during and between the paroxysms would provide clues for the mechanisms of paroxysmal OTR ( Table 2 ). The torsional nystagmus is ipsiversive if riMLF is irritated while it"
oh2009,"would be absent or contraversive when riMLF is damaged [3,17] .I n contrast, the torsional nystagmus is contraversive when INC is stimulated [9,14,17] . Three patients (patients 2, 3 and 5) showed ipsiversive torsional nystagmus during the paroxysms, which suggests that activation of ipsilesional riMLF was responsible for the paroxysmal ipsiversive OTR. Two (patients 2 and 5) of them also exhibited slowedvertical saccades and decreased amplitude of ipsiversive torsional nystagmus on torsional VOR during the interictal periods, which also indicate underlying dysfunction of riMLF [3,18] . In contrast, two patients (patients 1 and 7) exhibited contraversive torsional nystag- mus during the episodes, which indicates irritation (excitation) of ipsilesional INC during the paroxysms in these patients. The vertical GEN (patient 1) during the quiescent periods is also consistent with underlying dysfunction of INC. Most patients with ipsiversive paroxysmal OTR sustained cerebral hemorrhages. Even though the exact mechanism remains unknown, the extensive hemorrhagic lesions may have partially damaged riMLF or INC which also acted as an irritable focus during the paroxysms. In apatient (patient 3) with suspected multiple sclerosis, paroxysmal ephaptic spread of the action potentials across the adjacent axons within the demyelinating plaques may be responsible for these paroxysms. Previously, the paroxysmal skew-torsion initiated by rapid eye motion has been ascribed to activation of the burst cells of riMLF [10,19] . Indeed, three patients showed ipsiversive torsional nystagmus during the paroxysmal OTR. However, the associated contraversivetorsional nystagmus in another two patients also suggests intermit- tent hyperactivation of the ipsilesional INC during the paroxysmal OTR (Table 1 ). In four patients, the paroxysmal eye movements improved with carbamazepine, gabapentin, clonazepam or baclofen. The favorable"
oh2009,"responses of paroxysmal OTR to those medications, which are known to suppress abnormal neural ﬁring, also support intermittent hyperactivation of riMLF or INC as a mechanism of paroxysmal OTR. In conclusion, the associated ocular motor ﬁndings in patients with paroxysmal OTR indicate that the paroxysmal eye movements in mesodiencephalic lesions are caused by intermittent irritation of partially damaged ipsilesional riMLF or INC.

A lesion involving below the inferior pons develops ipsiversive OTR, whereas a lesionabove the inferior pons leads to contraversive OTR. A lateral medul-lary infarction usually causes ipsiversive OTR. This is the ﬁrst reportof contraversive OTR following the lateral medullary infarction. Case Report: A 58-year-old woman was admitted due to sudden-onset vertigo and gait disturbance. A neurological examination revealedOTR to the left side (left head tilt, leftward ocular torsion, and skewdeviation). Lateropulsion to the right and dysmetria on the right arm and leg were present. Diffusion-weighted MRI revealed an acute infarction of the right lateral medulla and the posterolateral pons. Thepatient slowly improved and can walk without sway after 1 week.Neither head tilt nor ataxia was observed after 3 months. Conclusions: Lateral medullary lesion typically results in ipsilateral OTR. Contraversive OTR of our patient might be derived from thedisruption of the cerebellovestibular inhibitory pathway by the lesionin the juxtarestiform body in the lateral medulla. Key Words: ocular tilt reaction, medulla, cerebral infarction (The Neurologist 2015;19:79–81) Ocular tilt reaction (OTR) is a type of vestibular dys- function in the roll plane. Patients with OTR present with a characteristic triad of conjugated ocular torsion, skewed deviation, and head tilt.1In addition, OTR is frequently accompanied by a deviation of the subjective visual verticalﬁeld. Unilateral lesions of the graviceptive pathway from theotoliths to the midbrain can result in OTR. 2Medullary lesions"
cho2015,"below the intersection of the graviceptive pathway usually results in ipsiversive OTR.3We report a patient with the lateral medullary infarction, who subsequently developed contra-versive OTR. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old woman was admitted with sudden-onset vertigo and gait disturbance. She had been treated for hypertension for theprevious 3 years. The blood pressure and heart rate were 200/92 mmHg and 79/minute, respectively. Neurological examination revealed aleftward OTR. The patient’s head was tilted toward the left side andcounterclockwise cyclotorsion was observed (Fig. 1A). The degree ofintorsion in the right eye was 3.5 degrees and the degree of extorsion in the left eye was 16.2 degrees (Fig. 1B). The patient’s subjective visual vertical ﬁeld was deviated to the left side (from 4 trials: + 4.6 degrees/+ 4.3 degrees/ + 3.1 degrees/ + 2.0 degrees; the average was + 3.5degrees, normal is ± 1.8 degrees). A skew deviation was present withleft hypotropia. Gaze evoked nystagmus was shown during the rightlateral gaze. The patient’s pupil sizes and reﬂexes to light were normal.No facial palsy, facial sensory changes, or hearing impairments were detected. Motor sensory examination and the deep tendon reﬂexes were normal. Lateropulsion was present; she fell to the right side whenshe attempted the tandem gait. Dysmetria was shown in the right armand leg. Diffusion-weighted MRI revealed acute infarctions on theposterolateral regions of the right medulla and pons (Figs. 1C, D). MRangiography, carotid ultrasonography, and transcranial Doppler assessments were normal. The patient’s EKG was normal and trans- esophageal echocardiography revealed the presence of patent foramenovale. Total cholesterol (6.7 mmol/L) and low-density lipoprotein(4.9 mmol/L) levels were high. After 1 week, the patient slowlyimproved and can walk without sway."
cho2015,"Neither head tilt nor ataxia wasobserved after 3 months. DISCUSSION Our patient showed contraversive OTR after brainstem infarction involving the medullar and the pons. Developmentof ipsiversive OTR after the lateral medullary infarction of Wallenberg syndrome is well known. However, the develop- ment of contraversive OTR from the lateral medullaryinfarction has not been reported. OTR may result from irritative or destructive lesions of the central or peripheral graviceptive vestibular pathways. 2A lesion involving below the inferior pons develops ipsiversiveOTR, whereas a lesion above the inferior pons leads to con-traversive OTR. 3Graviceptive information, which is perceived by the vertical semicircular canal and the otolith organ, is delivered to the vestibular nucleus, and the information crossesto the opposite side in the inferior pons and the mediallongitudinal fasciculus, which is connected to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal. Stimulation of the vestibular nucleus on one side elicits OTR on the opposite side and stimulation on theinterstitial nucleus of Cajal elicits an ipsilateral OTR. A contraversive OTR had been reported after unilateral cerebellar lesions; the OTR may be under inhibitory control ofthe posterior cerebellum, possibly the nodulus. Mossman andHalmagyi 4described 2 patients with OTR that developed fol- lowing cerebellar stroke involving the nodulus. They specu- lated that interruption of the nodular inhibitory projections tothe ipsilateral vestibular nuclei might have accounted for thecontraversive OTR. Disinhibition of the vestibular nucleus can increase in the activity of the ipsilateral graviceptive pathway, consequently producing contraversive OTR. 5,6Because recent report demonstrated that the dentate nucleus is also crucial for contraversive OTR in the cerebellar stroke, the dentate nucleus may be one of relay site between the cerebellum and thevestibular nucleus. 7From the Department of Neurology, Yonsei University College of Medi- cine, Seoul, Korea.

The medullary lesion of our patient might be the inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP), which connects the cerebellum with the medullaand the spinal cord. The ICP has 2 parts: the restiform bodyand the juxtarestiform body. The juxtrarestiform body is lying just medial to ICP. The restiform body is afferent system and the juxtarestiform body is mainly efferent. Primary component ofthe juxtarestiform body is the cerebellovestibular ﬁbers from the ﬂocculonodular lobe and the vermis. 8In our patient, it can be postulated that the lesion involving the juxtarestiform body inthe lateral medulla causes disruption of the cerebellovestibularinhibitory pathway and results in contraversive OTR. Our patient had another lesion in the pons; the contraversive OTR can be elicited by the pontine lesion involving the medial longitudinalfasciculus. Because the pontine lesion of our patient was far fromthe midline, the possibility of the contraversive OTR by the lateral pontine lesion might be low. The vascular territory of our patient was the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) area. The AICA supplies the middle"
cho2015,"cerebellar peduncle, the inferolateral portion of pons, the anterior- inferior cerebellum, and the ﬂocculus. While the AICA usuallysupplies the ﬂocculus, other areas are more variable and depend onthe dominance of the AICA, superior cerebellar artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The inf erolateral pons is usually involved in most patients experiencing AICA infarctions. The infarctions byAICA occlusion sometimes exte nds up to the middle third of the lateral pons and down to the superior part of the lateral medulla. 9,10 A recent report on OTR following AICA infarction revealed that 9of 12 patients experiencing AICA infarctions presented with oculartorsion. Six patients showed ipsiversive ocular torsion, and the remaining 3 patients showed contraversive ocular torsion. 11In patients with ipsiversive ocular torsion, hearing loss and skew deviation were observed. This may be explained by the fact that theinternal auditory artery branch ed from the AICA and supplies the inner ear. 5,12In contrast, none of the patients with contraversive ocular torsion presented with head tilts, skew deviation, or hearing loss. The authors suggested that a lesion in the ﬂocculus might bemore likely to result in contraversive ocular torsion. However, in our patient, no cerebellar lesion i ncluding the ﬂocculus was found. It can be speculated that a lesion in the lateral medulla, which is supplied by the AICA, can cause contraversive OTR. Our patientshowed head tilt and skew deviation, but all previous 3 patients with contraversive ocular torsion di d not have either head tilt or skew deviation. 11Differences of the lesion location from previous report might be associated with the presence of head tilt and skewdeviation. CONCLUSIONS This is the ﬁrst report of contraversive OTR following the lateral medullary infarction. Contraversive OTR shown in our patient might be derived from the disruption of the cer-"

Euro J of Neurology - 2022 - Friedrich - Current‐dependent ocular tilt reaction in deep brain stimulation of the,"Background and purpose: The aim was to characterize a combined vestibular, ocular  motor and postural syndrome induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic  nucleus in a patient with Parkinson's disease. Methods: In a systematic DBS programming session, eye, head and trunk position in roll  and pitch plane were documented as a function of stimulation amplitude and field di - rection. Repeat ocular coherence tomography was used to estimate ocular torsion. The  interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), zona incerta (ZI) and ascending vestibular fibre tracts  were segmented on magnetic resonance imaging using both individual and normative  structural connectomic data. Thresholded symptom-  associated volumes of tissue acti - vated (VTA) were calculated based on documented stimulation parameters. Results: Ipsilateral ocular tilt reaction and body lateropulsion as well as contralateral tor - sional nystagmus were elicited by the right electrode in a current-  dependent manner and  subsided after DBS deactivation. With increasing currents, binocular tonic upgaze and  body retropulsion were observed. Symptoms were consistent with an irritative effect on  the INC. Symptom-  associated VTA was found to overlap with the dorsal ZI and the ipsi - lateral vestibulothalamic tract, while lying rather distant to the INC proper. A ZI-  to- INC  ‘incerto-  interstitial’ tract with contact to the medial-  uppermost portion of the VTA could  be traced. Conclusion: Unilateral stimulation of INC-  related circuitry induces an ipsilateral vestibu - lar, ocular motor and postural roll- plane syndrome, which converts into a pitch- plane syn - drome when functional activation expands bilaterally. In this case, tractography points to  an incerto-  interstitial pathway, a tract previously only characterized in non- human pri - mates. Directional current steering proved useful in managing this rare side effect. KEYWORDS deep brain stimulation, movement disorders, vestibular 1546  |    FRIEDRICH Et al.

In single cases  of DBS for movement disorders, subtle vestibulo- perceptive signs like  deviations of the subjective visual vertical (SVV) and altered motion  perception have been reported [2]. Vestibular- ocular motor (VOM) side  effects such as an ocular tilt reaction (OTR), however, are highly un- usual, probably due to stimulation targets lying remote from mesodi- encephalic VOM reflex arcs. Therefore, VOM deficits have so far only  rarely been reported in the context of DBS. In one case, ipsiversive OTR  and contraversive torsional nystagmus was described after implantation  of an electrode into the periaqueductal grey, which required electrode  repositioning and deactivation of the impulse generator [3]. The authors  assumed irritative effects on the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), which  is the neural integrator for vertical- torsional eye and head movements  and the projection target for otolith and vertical semicircular canal sig- nals conveyed through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) [4,5].  This hypothesis is in line with experimental evidence demonstrating  ipsiversive OTR as a stereotypically coordinated eye- head synkinesis  evoked by electrical stimulation of the rostral midbrain tegmentum [6],  as well as seminal work on the mesodiencephalic and pontomedullary  circuitry involved in processing of graviceptive signals [7]. CASE DESCRIPTION History A 58- year- old patient with Parkinson's disease reported perceiv- ing ‘poles tilted like the tower of Pisa’ since activation of DBS of the  subthalamic nucleus (Boston Scientific® Gevia/Cartesia) implanted  1 year prior. After a DBS programming session 3 months post implan - tation he started noticing a further increase of these symptoms, which  were then accompanied by a rightward head tilt and falling tendency  to the right. In this programming session, the right electrode's field  was steered towards the lowermost contact in an attempt to allevi- ate a persisting, moderate left sided hypokinesia. He denied vertigo,  diplopia, or other focal neurological signs. He reported two situations"
Euro J of Neurology - 2022 - Friedrich - Current‐dependent ocular tilt reaction in deep brain stimulation of the,"where he nearly fell to the right side upon turning. Once a keen cyclist,  he had more and more refrained from riding his bike due to perceived  trouble keeping his balance. Initially, the patient did not associate  these balance issues with preceding DBS programming sessions and  rather accounted the symptoms to parkinsonism per se. Clinical and  quantitative neuro-  otological and  - ophthalmological examination In the medication/stimulation ON state, a left- dominant hypokinetic-   rigid syndrome (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III 14 points, DBS improvement in meds-  off 62%), rightward head tilt and  lateropulsion besides difficulties in tandem walking were noted.  Neuro-  ophthalmological assessment revealed a complete right - ward OTR with conjugate 10° clockwise ocular torsion as disclosed  on non-  mydriatic fundus photography and a binocular rightward  10° SVV deviation using the bedside bucket test [8]. Ocular coher - ence tomography disclosed residual clockwise ocular torsion of  −9.5°/−2.1° (right/left eye) shortly after DBS deactivation decreas - ing to −4.7°/0.6° after overnight withdrawal (Figure 1a). Apparative  neuro-  otological assessment (including video head impulse test) was  unremarkable. DBS programming Systematic testing of DBS parametrization (130 Hz, 60 µs) revealed  that OTR was influenced exclusively and reproducibly by contact 14  (facing supero-  postero-  medially) of the right lead. OTR magnitude  could be modulated linearly starting from 5° rightward SVV devia - tion at 1.8 mA to approximately 10° at 2.2 mA and 25° at 4.5 mA  (Figure 1b) accompanied by increasing rightward lateropulsion, skew  deviation, and a torsional nystagmus beating to the left (Video S1).  Upon further increase, binocular tonic upgaze and diagonal latero- pulsion evolved into retropulsion, requiring the exploration to be  stopped immediately. The patient felt ‘being drawn rightwards’.  Anterolateral current steering on the same level reduced vestibular  effects (1."
Euro J of Neurology - 2022 - Friedrich - Current‐dependent ocular tilt reaction in deep brain stimulation of the,"4 mA, 7° SVV) while preserving antiparkinsonian effects  (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III 12 points). Imaging and  VTA modelling Cranial computed tomography disclosed no intracranial pathologies  but a relatively obtuse and caudal trajectory of the right electrode.  Lead localization and VTA modelling (Figure 2) disclosed the ex - tension of VOM-  syndrome-  related VTA portions supero-  postero-  medially towards the dorsal zona incerta (dZI) (Figure 1b– d). VTA  also overlapped with the ipsilateral vestibulo-  thalamic tract (iVTT)  and a tract projecting from the dZI towards the INC (Figure 1c,d). DISCUSSION Several nodes and projections of vestibular, ocular motor, and sen - sorimotor networks reside in the region of the mesodiencephalic  junction and therefore may be potential anatomical substrates of the  complex observations reported in this case. From a clinical and neuroanatomical perspective, the ocular  motor and postural findings in our case can primarily be related to  the INC, which serves as the integrator of eye and head position  along the roll and pitch plane [7].

In our case, it is reasoned that a gradual ex - citation of projections to the INC can explain the current-  dependent  OTR ipsilateral to DBS, while contralateral torsional nystagmus at  higher currents speaks for additional activation of integrator neu - rons directly in the INC [4,5]. Importantly, these findings closely cor - respond to reports of paroxysmal ipsiversive OTR hypothesized to  originate from irritative effects of mesodiencephalic lesions on INC  and/or rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF (riMLF) neurons [10,11].  To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first to recapitulate a  lesional eye movement disorder in a reversible manner by means of  electrical stimulation, thereby corroborating abnormal excitation of  the INC as a pathomechanistic underpinning of ipsiversive OTR.Evolving conjugate tonic upgaze and retropulsion indicate  a propagation of excitation across the midline [5]. Given the  topographical relations and comparably low stimulation ampli - tudes, direct current spread over the midline can be excluded  as a mechanism. With dense posterior commissure projections  interconnecting the bilateral INC [5], synaptic mechanisms for  signal transmission to the contralateral INC could be presumed.  This transition of ocular motor and postural symptoms from roll  to pitch plane with increase of stimulation currents is consistent  with the ‘double roll = pitch’ framework [7]. However, conversely,  experimental evidence in primates demonstrates a similar upward  ocular motor bias with bilateral lesions to the INC areas resulting  in downbeat nystagmus [9]. The most parsimonious explanation  for this finding may be dose-   and tissue-  dependent differential ef - fects of DBS like axonal excitation evolving into somatic inhibition,  inducing complex network effects [12]. However, the differential FIGURE 1  Synopsis of findings."

Euro J of Neurology - 2022 - Friedrich - Current‐dependent ocular tilt reaction in deep brain stimulation of the,"effects of DBS on sensorimotor networks remains an area of ac - tive debate. Involvement of the nuclear centres of eye movement (third and  fourth cranial nerve) or the riMLF seems highly unlikely. The binocu - lar pattern of vertical dissociation and torsional conjugacy, as well as  the absence of double vision, argue against a lesion to the third and  fourth nerve nucleus or fascicle. Ipsilateral excitation of the riMLF  by DBS should result in an ipsiversive torsional nystagmus based on  previous experimental considerations [5], while a contraversive tor - sional nystagmus was present in our case. Neuroanatomical modelling of the VTA indicated no over - lap with the INC but only with the ZI and the iVTT. Importantly,  however, a projection from the ZI to the INC could be traced  (Figure 1d). Therefore, it is hypothesized that INC modulation in  this patient was most probably induced through a potentially ab - errant ‘incerto-  interstitial tract’. A similar tract was reported sev - eral decades ago in the cat, where stimulation led to excitation of  the ipsilateral INC and resulted in an ipsiversive OTR-  like pattern  [13]. Moreover, simultaneous modulation of iVTT axons may ad - ditionally contribute to the enormous SVV deviation [14], in line  with theoretical considerations of tissue-  dependent differential  effects of DBS [12].These case-  based findings should of course be interpreted with  caution and confirmed in prospective studies, potentially correlating  fine-  grain ocular motor assays to VTA topographies. Nonetheless,  this case has three relevant aspects: (i) it gives mechanistic insight  into the functional anatomy of plane-  specific control of the eye,  head and body position in the midbrain, (ii) it allows inferences  about modes of action of DBS in sensorimotor circuits and (iii) it  underscores the utility of directional DBS for optimizing treatment  efficacy.

OTR is an eye-head postural reaction consisting of head tilt, skew devia- tion, conjugated eye cyclotorsion, and alteration of vertical perception, and is thought to occur with central lesions,mainly brainstem lesions. Here, we report a case of a patient who was suffering from left acute peripheral cochleovestibular loss. He had profound deafness andabsence of caloric response on the left side. No central lesion was observed on magnetic resonance images. Neuro- ophthalmological examination showed OTR consisting ofhead tilt, skew deviation with left hypotropia, excyclotor- sion, and tilt of the static visual vertical directed to the left side. Both utricular and saccular dysfunctions were iden-tiﬁed by the absence of cervical vestibular evoked myo- genic potential (cVEMP) and ocular VEMP (oVEMP) on the left side. Within a month, the OTR disappeared com-pletely probably because of vestibular compensation. This is the ﬁrst report to state that the peripheral otolithdysfunction causing reversible vertical diplopia was iden- tiﬁed by objective examinations (VEMP).

Here, we report a case of a patient who suffered from left acute peripheral cochleovestibular loss."
goto2011,"Recently, two useful tests for evaluating otolith functions have been reported. One is the determination of cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) generated from the contracted sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles inresponse to an air-conducted sound (ACS) or bone-con- ducted vibration (BCV), and the other is the determination of ocular VEMP (oVEMP) generated from the contracted extraocular muscles (inferior rectus and inferior oblique) in response to ACS and/or BCV. The knowledge of thesemyogenic potentials plays an important role in the diagnosis of vestibular diseases. A recent study has reported that the early negative oVEMP (n10) and early positive cVEMP(p13) generated in response to the short tone bursts (STB) of BCV delivered to the midline of the forehead at the hairline (a location called Fz) or those generated in response to ACSstimulation indicate crossed utricular function and uncros- sed saccular function, respectively [ 4]. These new diagnostic tools clearly indicate the presence of otolith dysfunction in patients with skew deviation.F. Goto, Y. Ban, and T. Tsutumi contributed equally to this work. F. Goto (&)/C1T.

goto2011,"Case presentation A 45-year-old man presented at our hospital with vertigo, vertical diplopia, and left-sided hearing loss on April 12,2010. His hearing on the left side was in the ‘‘scale-out’’ zone (Fig. 1). The patient had no history of health disor- ders. Horizontal-torsional spontaneous nystagmus directedrightward and leftward head tilt were noted. cVEMPs and oVEMPs were generated using 500 Hz STB at Fz in this patient. Strong asymmetric cVEMPamplitudes of the p13–n23 complex were recorded for the left (affected side) and right (normal side) sides (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, oVEMPs generated in response to BCVand ACS recorded for both eyes showed symmetric n10 amplitudes (Fig. 2b, c). No oVEMPs were generated in response to ACS and BCV on the affected side. The caloric test with video-oculography (VOG) involving the use of water at 20 /C176C for irrigation produced no response on the left side and a response of 6 /C176C/s on the right side. Canal paralysis was noted on the left side. Ophthalmologic examination was conducted the next day. The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity in the right eyewas 0.9 D [standard deviation (SD) =- 8.0] and in the lefteye was 1.0 D ( -8.0). His eye movements were full. Alternate prism cover test showed 14 prism diopters ( D)o f right hypertropia for near vision and 16 Dof right hyper- tropia for distant vision. He also had bilateral incipientcataract. Findings of anterior segment and fundus exam- inations were unremarkable. On day 7, the eye positions in the nine directions of gaze showed that his eye movementwas full and smooth. Right hypertropia was noticed for all the nine directions. Skew deviation and head tilt were also observed (Figs. 3,4). On day 9 after the onset of the symptoms, the ocular motility range measured using the Hess chart also showed right hypertropia."
goto2011,"Fundus photo-graph showed incyclotorsion of 2 /C176in the right eye and excyclotorsion of 8 /C176in the left eye (Fig. 5). No central lesion was identiﬁed in the neuroradiological ﬁndings including those from the magnetic resonance (MR) images. There was no apparent cardiovascular dysfunction identiﬁed by routine work-up. All the symptoms, namely,head tilt, conjugated eye cyclotorsion, skew deviation, and alteration of vertical perception clearly indicated OTR. Intravenous steroid therapy was administered for a weekfor acute hearing loss. He was discharged on the 11th day after admission. His vertical diplopia disappeared by day 21. The subjective visual vertical had deviated toward theaffected side and showed the following values: 12.5 /C176on day 5, 10 /C176on day 7, 5.5 /C176on day 21, and 3.3 /C176on day 60. His spontaneous nystagmus persisted until day 60, and hecontinued to complain about dizziness until the ﬁfth month. The hearing loss in his left ear improved to approximately 58.8 dB (average of 5 different frequencies, namely, 250,500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz). Both cVEMP and AC- BCoVEMP remained negative even after 6 months fol- lowing the onset of symptoms. Discussion Skew deviation is normally associated with a central lesion, except if there is a complete peripheral vestibular lesionaffecting the superior and inferior vestibular nerve. No central lesion was identiﬁed in this case. In the case of peripheral lesion, skew deviation occurs after vestibularneurectomy. Thus far, only a few case reports have described skew deviation originating from peripheral ves- tibular dysfunction [ 2]. Vertical diplopia is rarely encountered in routine clinical practice. The peripheral vestibular system consists of canals and otolith organs. The canal system is conventionally evalu-ated using the caloric test and rotational chair test. How- ever, clinical examinations do not always indicate otolith (utricle and saccule) dysfunction."
goto2011,"Recent advances in the otolith function tests make it possible to evaluate saccular and utricular functions separately by using VEMPs. The Fig. 1 Pure-tone (PT) audiogram showing profound hearing loss on the left side1094 Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol (2011) 268:1093–1096 123 VEMPs recorded on the SCM muscles are called cVEMPs; they are useful because they reﬂect the functions of the eighth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve) in a mannerthat differs from those revealed by the caloric test and auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), which predomi- nantly suggest saccular functions [ 1,2]. Recent studies conducted on the myogenic potentials recorded around the eyes indicate their vestibular origin [ 3,4]. These are called oVEMPs. The oVEMPs generated in response to ACSreﬂect the function of a population of neurons of the peripheral vestibular system, possibly the utricular affer- ents [ 4]. The n10 component of the oVEMP generated in response to either ACS or BCV probably indicates pre- dominant superior vestibular nerve function [ 5]. In this patient, no responses were observed for cVEMP and oVEMP. This indicated that both saccular and utricular functions were affected by acute cochleovestibular loss. His OTR might have recovered because of central Fig. 2 cVEMPs ( a) and oVEMPs ( b,c) generated in response to 500 Hz STB [95 dB above normal adult hearing level (nHL)]. NocVEMPs generated in response to left-ear stimulation and normal cVEMPs generated in response to right-ear stimulation. acVEMPs generated in response to air-conducted 500 Hz STB response wasobserved on the right side but not on the left side, indicating sacculardysfunction in the left ear. boVEMP generated in response to bone- conducted 500 Hz STB B1is the recording from the left eye and B2, from the right eye. n10 is observed in B1but not in B2, indicating theabsence of utricular function in the left ear."

C1and C3were recorded from the left eye; C2andC4, from the right eye. Right-ear stimulation generates n10 response ( C1) and left-ear stimulation generates no response ( C3andC4), indicating utricular dysfunction on the left side Fig. 3 Eye position in the nine directions on day 7. His eye movement is full and smooth. Right hypertropia in all the nine directions can be noted.

This is the ﬁrst report to state that not only the central but also peripheral otolithdysfunction can cause reversible vertical diplopia. As etiology in this case, it might have been vascular affecting the inner ear. The routine cardiovascular work-upof the patient did not reveal any problems. If there was any possibility of the cardiovascular problems, a treatment with aspirin should be required. In conclusion, we report that the cVEMP and oVEMP are useful clinical tools for the evaluation of OTR causedby acute cochleovestibular dysfunction as it provides valuable information on otolith organs.

dresner2017,"Skew deviation is a rare side effect of intratympanic gentamicin injection for intractable Meniere ’s disease. When the skew deviation is accompanied by pathologic head tilt and ocular torsion, the result is an ocular tilt reaction (OTR).

The authors also review the reported cases of skew deviation following intratympanic gentamicin and confirm this phenomenon, which has only rarely been reported in the literature.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 27 January 2017 Revised 13 February 2017 Accepted 14 February 2017 KEYWORDS Gentamicin; ocular tilt reaction; skew deviation Introduction Skew deviation, a vertical misalignment of the eyes due to damage along the supranuclear pathway connecting the otolith organs to the ocular motor nuclei, is a rare side effect of intratympanic genta- micin injection for intractable Meniere ’s disease (MD). When the skew deviation is also accompa- nied by pathologic head tilt and ocular torsion, the result is an ocular tilt reaction (OTR). We report a case of gentamicin-induced skew deviation with partial OTR and summarise the existent literature on the matter.

Discussion Meniere ’s disease is a chronic disorder caused by excess endolymph regulation in the labyrinth, leading to episodic attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, aural fullness,and low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Intratympanic injection of gentamicin, an aminogly- coside antibiotic that destroys vestibular hair cells, is one ablative treatment option for intractable symptoms.1 We identified three case reports in the literature2–4that reported similar skew deviation following intratympanic gentamicin injection (Table 1 ). In these patients, the onset of symp- toms post-injection averaged 4 days, with a range of 3 –5 days. Our patient had onset of symptoms 8 days post-injection, a slightly longer delay between injection and onset of symptoms compared with other pat ients reported in the literature, a finding likely due to inter-individual pharmacokinetic variation in gentamicin absorption.5Spontaneous resolution of symp- toms occurred within 4 weeks of symptom onset in our patient, slightly earlier than the 6–8 weeks reported in the other cases, although our patient continued to have referable physical examination findings, including a right hyperde- viation, more pronounced on rightward gaze, with intorsion of the higher eye. The standard amounts of gentamicin used in the cases observed in the literature also suggest that skew deviation and vertical diplopia following injec- tion may not be dose dependent. Skew deviation is characterised by a vertical misalignment of the eyes due to damage along the supranuclear pathway connecting the otolith organs to the ocular motor nuclei.6An ocular tilt reaction occurs when a skew deviation is Figure 1.

The ascending pathway starts in the utricle, travels along the ipsilateral vestibular"
dresner2017,"nerve, then decussates in the pons, and ascends in the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF).7An OTR can be caused by both central (e.g., midbrain, pons, or cerebellum) and periph- eral lesions (e.g., otolith-utricle and vestibular nerve). Lesions occurring rostral to the point of decussation are classically associated with ipsilat- eral ocular hypertropia, whereas lesions occurring caudal to the point of decussation are classically associated with ipsilateral ocular hypotropia.7 Our patient ’s presentation was consistent with a left peripheral vestibulopathy induced by gentamicin injection. Although he did not have a pathologic leftward head tilt, the skew deviation with a hyper- tropic right eye, hypotropic left eye, incyclotorsion of the hypertropic right eye, and excyclotorsion of the hypotropic left eye support our diagnosis of a partial left ocular tilt reaction.

This suggests that neuroimaging may not be required in all pati ents with skew deviation, particularly if known to be peripheral or provoked by gentamicin injection. In conclusion, we confirm that skew deviation can rarely occur following gentamicin injection for Meniere ’s disease."

Nesse mesmo ano, Westheimer e Blair,6  estudando os efeitos de estímulos elétricos no tronco  cerebral de macacos, evidenciaram um conjunto de  respostas simultâneas caracterizadas por SD, inclina - ção da cabeça e torção ocular, o qual denominaram  de ocular tilt reaction  (OTR). Essa tríade clássica  somente foi descrita pela primeira vez em seres hu - manos em 1977, por Rabinovitch et al.7 Na prática  neurológica diária, estrabismos verticais por vezes  são difíceis de ser diferenciados: SD, OTR (central  ou periférica) ou paralisia do nervo troclear?

O sistema otolítico (sáculo  e utrículo) responde à aceleração linear (translação) e  também à força da gravidade.1,2  Em muitos pacientes, o estrabismo vertical no  SD associa-se à inclinação da cabeça e à torção ocu - lar. Esse conjunto recebe a denominação de OTR.2  Quando inclinamos a cabeça para a esquerda (aproxi - mando a orelha do ombro do mesmo lado), o utrícu - lo é primariamente ativado, gerando um movimento  ocular torcional compensatório na direção oposta à  da inclinação da cabeça.8 Nos humanos, a inclinação  da cabeça é o maior componente do OTR fisiológi - co1 (Figura 1).

Na curva, a motociclista inclina o corpo para a  esquerda e a cabeça para a direita (linhas brancas) de modo a se  aproximar do vetor da força gravitacional e, dessa forma, manter a  verticalidade (Foto: Marcelo Alves; motociclista: Samara Andrade –  imagem autorizada). OTR representa uma resposta de endireitamento  cujo objetivo é o de realinhar o eixo vertical tanto da  cabeça quanto dos olhos para a estimativa interna,  ainda que errônea, do eixo vertical absoluto da ter - ra.9 No caso apenas da inclinação da cabeça para o  lado esquerdo, o movimento de rotação ocular está - tico ( static ocular counterroll ) se deve à ativação dos"

OTR é provavelmente um remanescente vestigial do  reflexo primitivo de endireitamento, e tais movimen - tos rotacionais são compensatórios em apenas 10° a  20° do desvio da posição vertical.2  O reflexo utrículo-ocular se origina na mácula do  órgão otolítico, o utrículo, que atua como um ace - lerômetro linear. As células ciliares da mácula utri - cular possuem ampla gama de vetores polarizáveis  e sensíveis ao movimento da cabeça em diferentes  direções.9 Assim sendo, os utrículos normalmente  medeiam o reflexo vestíbulo-ocular durante o movi - mento linear ou translacional da cabeça, assim como  o movimento ocular counterroll  durante a inclinação  estática da cabeça.2,8,10 Havendo alguma disfunção  dessa via, ocorre também um erro na estimativa in - terna da verticalidade, com desvio da vertical visual  subjetiva.11  Etiopatogenia SD e OTR podem ser observados não apenas na  disfunção vestibular periférica, mas também nas le - sões das vias graviceptivas, que ascendem do bulbo  ao mesencéfalo.1 A disfunção da via utrículo-ocular  unilateral devida a uma lesão vestibular tanto perifé - rica quanto central pode resultar de qualquer tipo de"

Quando os  exames de neuroimagem são negativos, isso aponta  para a possibilidade de lesão isquêmica, muito discre - ta, no tronco cerebral.1  Quadro clínico e diagnóstico de localização Na OTR a inclinação da cabeça é ipsilateral ao olho  hipotrópico, e os polos superiores dos olhos giram  na mesma direção da inclinação da cabeça. Também  faz parte do quadro clínico o desvio da vertical vi - sual subjetiva para o mesmo lado da torção ocular  (Figura 2). Apesar disso, exceto pela diplopia, OTR  raramente causa sintomas por si só.1 É importante  salientar que o conjunto de sinais citados contrasta  com o ocular counterroll  fisiológico, no qual os polos  superiores de ambos os olhos giram na direção opos - ta à da inclinação da cabeça.2,8 Brandt e Dieterich reviram 155 pacientes com  diagnóstico clínico de infarto agudo unilateral do  tronco cerebral. Desses, 36% demonstraram SD  associado a torção ocular. Acometimento bilateral  ocorreu em 50% dos casos. Em todos os casos de  lesão pontobulbar ocorreu SD ipsiversivo (para o  lado do olho mais baixo), enquanto as lesões pon - tomesencefálicas e mesodiencefálicas causaram SD  contraversivo.12  Casos de SD não comitante – quando a hipertro - pia varia de acordo com a posição dos olhos na ór - bita – são difíceis de serem diferenciados da paralisia"

Nas lesões vestibulares nucleares, por exemplo,  na síndrome de Wallemberg, pode ocorrer SD com  hipotropia do lado da lesão, além de inclinação da  cabeça e torção ocular para o mesmo lado e discreta  inciclotorção contralateral, no olho hipertrópico. A  torção ocular pode ser dissociada com maior extor - ção no olho hipotrópico.8  Pacientes com lesões cerebelares também podem  apresentar SD. O comprometimento do fascículo  longitudinal medial pode gerar SD com hipertropia  homolateral. Lesões no mesencéfalo, onde projeções  otolíticas contatam com os núcleos do III e IV ner - vos craniais e o núcleo intersticial de Cajal (NIC),  provocam SD e OTR com o olho hipertrópico ipsi - lateral à lesão, além de ciclotorção ocular e desvio da  cabeça contralaterais.2 Figura 2.

No caso de paresia do nervo troclear esquerdo,  por exemplo, o olho hipertrópico é o homolateral  (1), e a hipertropia e a diplopia pioram quando o  paciente olha para o lado direito (2), assim como  quando inclina a cabeça para esse mesmo lado (3).

Até recentemente  o SD era considerado um distúrbio raro, sem locali - zação anatômica específica e sempre associado a pa - cientes debilitados. Entretanto, estudos mais recen - tes mostraram que: a) SD é comum; b) a lesão causal  pode ser clinicamente localizada; c) pode acometer  pacientes plenamente conscientes e deambulantes;  d) eventualmente compõe um contexto mais geral  denominado OTR."
"maranhao-filho, 2015","Se a síndrome clínica permitir a  localização da lesão, o SD indica o lado acometido.  Mas se, de acordo com a síndrome clínica, o lado  da lesão for evidente, o local da lesão no tronco ce - rebral é indicado pela direção do SD: ipsiversivo na lesão caudal (pontobulbar) e contraversivo na lesão  cranial (pontomesencefálica). Pelo fato de SD/OTR  poder clinicamente mimetizar o estrabismo vertical  da paralisia do nervo troclear, eles contribuem para  o diagnóstico correto da última, a história, o exame  oculomotor detalhado, a unil ateralidade e a direção  da ciclotorção, além dos resultados dos exames de  imagem.

brodsky2012,"Torsional augmentation for the treatment of lateropulsion and torticollis in partial ocular tilt reaction Michael C. Brodsky, MD,a,band Jonathan M. Holmes, BM, BCha PURPOSE We describe a new surgical treatment for lateropulsion and torticollis arising from an ocular tilt reaction. METHODS Visual sensory parameters and postural abnormalities were retrospectively reviewed ina patient with a partial ocular tilt reaction who was treated with horizontal transpositionof the vertical rectus muscles to surgically augment preexisting binocular torsion. RESULTS Torsional augmentation eliminated the sensation of lateropulsion and produced almostcomplete resolution of her torticollis and associated body tilt. CONCLUSIONS Binocular torsional augmentation can be used to reduce both lateropulsion and torticollisin the setting of an ocular tilt reaction. ( J AAPOS 2012;16:141-144) The ocular tilt reaction is usually caused by unilat-eral injury to the brainstem or utricular pathwayssubserving central vestibular function in the roll plane. 1-3Mechanistically, a lesion of the right utricular pathways is equivalent to activation of the left utricle,creating a tilt of the subjective visual vertical to the right(as if the head were being tilted to the right to stimulatethe left utricle). 1-3This imbalance evokes a compensatory ocular tilt reaction, comprising skew deviation, binoculartorsion, and a head tilt toward the side that the patienterroneously perceives as vertical ( Figure 1 A). 1-3Because the head tilt is not compensatory for diplopia (unlike in superior oblique muscle palsy), surgical treatment of the vertical misalignment will not improve the associatedtorticollis. 4 Because the natural history of the ocular tilt reaction is often one of spontaneous resolution,5it is considered advisable to observe patients initially and to treat any asso-ciated diplopia conservatively with prisms. The associatedtorsion (consisting of an intorsion in the hypertropic eye and an extorsion in the hypotropic eye) produces a fairly conjugate torsional deviation that does not create animpediment to fusion once any vertical deviation resolves."
brodsky2012,"a vertical deviation fails to resolve, small recessions of thesuperior rectus muscle (in the higher eye) or inferior rectusmuscle (in the lower eye) will often restore single binocularvision, but such an approach does not address the headtilt. 6,7 Head tilt is usually a minor component of the ocular tilt reaction and rarely requires treatment. In rare instances,however, the patient may report a compelling sensationof being pulled to one side (lateropulsion) or a large persis-tent head tilt. 8In this situation, we reasoned that paradox- ically increasing the torsional position of the eyes to furtherrotate the eyes in the direction of the tilt would realign thevertical poles of eyes more closely with the tilted subjective visual vertical, thereby obviating the compensatory func- tion of the head tilt ( Figure 1 B). Because torsional rotation of both eyes counterrotates the visual image, this procedureshould counterrotate the tilted subjective visual verticalback toward the gravitational vertical, thereby reducingthe error signal that generates to the head tilt. To testthis hypothesis, we performed horizontal transpositionof the vertical rectus muscles to augment the preexisting binocular torsion as a means of treating lateropulsion and persistent torticollis in a patient with a partial ocular tiltreaction. Case Report Institutional review board approval was obtained for retro-spective chart review and the study conformed to the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Porta- bility and Accountability Act. A 59-year-old womanpresented with a 2-year history of lateropulsion withperpetual tilting of her whole body to the right. The onsetof her symptoms had been accompanied by acute vertigoand nausea, which resolved gradually during a 2-week pe-riod. When placed upright, she reported that it felt asthough other people were tilted to the right.

Her lateropulsion did not become noticeably worsein the dark. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a few nonspeciﬁc foci of T2-hyperintensities in the periventricu-lar and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemi-spheres, most likely representing ischemic small-vesseldisease without an infarction. Vestibular evaluationrevealed no objective ﬁndings of peripheral vestibulardisease. Testing of the subjective visual vertical in thedark with her head held in the neutral position demon- strated an average of 12.3 /C14bias to the right, which was well beyond two standard deviations of normal (4/C14)i n either direction. On presenting to the Strabismus Service at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, she was unable to properly judge vertical orientation of objects in her environment. Onour examination, she had right head tilt that varied from25 /C14to 45/C14and a constant tendency to lean her body to the right ( Figure 2 A), resulting in difﬁculty sitting in a chair without falling out of the chair and walking down a corridorwithout bumping into the wall. A compelling sense ofbeing pulled to the right (lateropulsion) caused her tolean rightward until gravitational constraints (preventinga fall) or physical constraints (walking into walls or pushingagainst the arm of her chair) caused her to stop. Her ocular motility showed full ductions and versions, and she was orthotropic at distance straight ahead and atnear ﬁxation."
brodsky2012,"She had no gaze-evoked or torsionalnystagmus. Prism and alternate cover test revealed 6 D exophoria and 1Dleft hyperphoria at distance straight ahead and 12Dof exophoria at near. The left hyperphoria did not increase on lateral gaze, up or down, and therewas no measurable hyperphoria on either right or lefthead tilt. Testing with double Maddox rods with herhead and body in the neutral position over several exam-inations revealed consistent right extorsion (5 /C14-9/C14)a n d consistent left intorsion (5/C14-10/C14). Retinal examination consistently showed moderate intorsion of the left eyeand marked extorsion of the right eye. When the patient’s head was held straight in the neutral position, she tilted objects to the right when attempting to orientthem vertically. When she tilted her head to the right,however, she was able to position them correctly. We designed our surgical approach to rotate the eyes in the direction of the tilt. Under general anesthesia, the12-o’clock and 6 o’clock positions were marked at thelimbus of each eye with a skin marking pen. 9The right su- perior rectus muscle was then transposed nasally a full ten-don width (10 mm), and the right inferior rectus musclewas transposed temporally a full tendon width (inducingfurther extorsion of the right eye). In addition, the left su-perior rectus muscle was transposed temporally a full ten-don width and the left inferior rectus muscle wastransposed nasally a full tendon width (inducing further in-torsion of the left eye). Before reversing general anesthesia, we noted that the positions of the limbal markings were extorted in the FIG 1. Therapeutic Effect of Torsional Augmentation. In the ocular tilt reaction, lesioning the right utricular pathways causes the subjective visual vertical to be tilted to the right. A, a compensatory oculocephalic synkinesis rotates the eyes and head to a position that the central nervous system erroneously interprets as is tilted to the right, resulting in torsional rotation of the superior aspect of both globes to the right and skew deviation.

B, after horizontal transpo- sition of the vertical rectus muscles, the transposed vertical rectus muscles rotate the eyes torsionally as connective tissue attachments within the orbit restore them to their previous positions. This torsional augmentation serves to more closely realign their vertical poles with the tilted subjective visual vertical. In so doing, it counterrotates the tilted subjective visual vertical back toward the gravitational vertical (curved arrow), thereby re-ducing the need for a compensatory head tilt.

The following day, the patient had3 Dof right hyperphoria. She was no longer leaning to the right and no longer had a head tilt. Seven weeks post-operatively, she maintained her improved body positionand head tilt, commenting that she “didn’t feel pulled anymore.” She had full ductions and versions, 5 Dexopho- ria in distance straight ahead, 8Dexophoria at near, with no measurable vertical phoria in any position of gaze. Double Maddox rod testing revealed 6/C14of subjective ex- torsion in the right eye and 6/C14of subjective intorsion in the left eye. One year after surgery, the patient had maintained her improvement and was able to sit straight in a chair (Figure 2 B), and only has a slight body tilt when walking, she speciﬁcally commented that she did not “run into walls” as she had done before surgery. Her head tilt hadimproved from 45 /C14to 5/C14(Figure 2 ). Discussion When the superior and inferior rectus muscles are horizon-tally transposed in opposite directions from each other, orbital elastic forces allow them to resume their normalpositions within the orbit. As they do so, they torsionally"
brodsky2012,"rotate the globes in the direction opposite to the originaltransposition, for example, nasally transposing the superiorrectus and temporally transposing the inferior rectusinduces an extorsion of the globe ( Figure 1 ). Vertical rectus muscle transposition has been used to treat other forms of torticollis, such as idiopathic head tilt and the rare head tilt associated with congenital nystagmus. 10Proponents of this procedure10,11believe that torsional rotation of the eyes in the direction of thehead tilt serves to induce a contraversive tilt of the visualworld, which stimulates the patient to straighten the headto move it into closer alignment with the tilted visualworld. Because previous patients with torticollis havenot reported induced visual tilt after successful treatment with vertical rectus transpositions, we suggest an alternative mechanism that we now propose for our caseof lateropulsion. We suggest that procedures to induceor augment binocular torsion may serve to realign thevertical meridians of the eyes with a tilted subjectivevisual vertical, which counter-rotates the tilted subjectivevertically back toward the gravitational vertical, therebyobviating the need for the head tilt. Our patient had an incomplete ocular tilt reaction associated with lateropulsion, a tilted subjective vertical,disconjugate torsion (greater in the extorted eye), anda postural tilt that was directed toward the subjectivevisual vertical. Although patients with this conditionmay not perceive the visual world as tilted, they consis-tently assign a tilted orientation when trying to orientobjects vertically. Dieterich and Brandt 12have found uniocular torsion with subjective visual tilt to be diagnos-tic of unilateral brainstem injury. Binocular torsion hasnot been found to accompany hemispheric lesions thatcause lateropulsion. 13 In our patient, torsional augmentation of the eyes produced resolution of lateropulsion and almost completenormalization of head and body position, restoring herability to correctly assign vertical orientation to objects in the visual world. When planning this procedure, it is important to rule out coexisting oblique muscle palsies,which can simulate the ocular tilt reaction."
brodsky2012,"The diagnosisof an incomplete ocular tilt reaction was conﬁrmed bydemonstrating intorsion of the higher eye (in contradis-tinction to the extorsion of the higher eye that is seen inpatients with superior oblique palsy). 14 While it could be argued that all components of the ocular tilt reaction (including the subjective visual tilt)are direct effects of neurological defects, Dieterich andBrandt 8postulated that the motor abnormalities are not neurological defects but compensatory rotations fora tilt in the subjective visual vertical caused by a unilaterallesion of central otolithic pathways. In our case, if thebinocular torsion had caused the subjective visual tilt,one would expect the subjective visual tilt to have in- creased when the objective binocular torsion was surgi- cally increased. Our observation that the subjective FIG 2. A, preoperative head tilt and body tilt characteristic of lateropul- sion. B, postoperative head and body position, showing improvement of from approximately 45/C14to 5/C14. Journal of AAPOSVolume 16 Number 2 / April 2012 Brodsky and Holmes 143 visual tilt and postural tilt resolved after surgery to in- crease the binocular torsion thus reinforces the notionthat the postural tilt is compensatory for an underlyingsubjective visual tilt, providing the driving force foreach component of the ocular tilt reaction. On the basis of the dramatic improvement in our patient when the objective binocular torsion was surgically in- creased, we postulate that surgery to reduce the objective preoperative binocular torsion would have the potentialto make the head tilt worse. This paradoxical response togenerating ocular torsion provides a cautionary note thatstrabismus surgery cannot always be designed to “ﬁx” thedeviation, particularly when its cause remains ill deﬁned.It is therefore essential to understand the driving forcebehind a deviation when designing optimal treatment. We conclude that horizontal transposition of the vertical rectus muscles to increase preexisting binocular torsionmay provide a simple treatment for the torticollis, latero-pulsion and other disabling symptoms of tilt that mayaccompany the ocular tilt reaction.
